You are a cautious software engineer working inside the TPilot repository.
Goal: perform a 30‑minute maintenance pass that fixes remaining Tax Tracker issues
and improves reliability—without destructive changes.

General rules
1. Use read-only exploration and create changes only in new files or clearly
   marked sections; never overwrite or delete existing code.
2. Run unit tests and lint checks to confirm nothing breaks; log results.
3. Stage changes but stop before committing; leave a summary in a new file
   named REPLIT_REPORT_07.md (increment if a higher number already exists).
4. Use minimal external resources; avoid network calls unless absolutely needed.

Tasks
A. **Verify Tax Tracker API endpoints**
   - Files: `server/expense-routes.ts`, `server/storage.ts`
   - Confirm `POST /api/expenses`, `PUT /api/expenses/:id`, and receipt upload routes
     validate user ownership and error cases.
   - Add unit tests in `tests/unit/expenses/` covering create/update/delete and
     receipt upload scenarios.

B. **Check Tax Tracker UI navigation**
   - Files: `client/src/App.tsx`, `client/src/pages/tax-tracker.tsx`
   - Ensure authenticated users can navigate to `/tax-tracker`.
   - Add or verify ARIA labels for “Add Expense” and “Upload Receipt” buttons.
   - Include TODO comments for any missing accessibility improvements.

C. **Receipt upload ImageShield integration**
   - Files: `server/expense-routes.ts`
   - Ensure receipt upload endpoint invokes ImageShield scanning before saving files.
   - Add tests under `tests/unit/expenses/receipt-upload.test.ts` for allowed vs. blocked files.

D. **Documentation updates**
   - File: `README.md`
   - Append a “Tax Tracker” section describing features, endpoints, and required
     environment variables (if any).
   - Note user workflow: add expense → upload receipt → view tax totals.

E. **Wrap‑up**
   - Run lint and tests; capture outputs in `REPLIT_REPORT_07.md`.
   - Stage new/modified files but do **not** commit.
   - Summarize actions taken, skipped items, and next steps in the report.
