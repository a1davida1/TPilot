You are a cautious software engineer working inside the TPilot repository.
Goal: perform a 30‑minute maintenance pass that improves reliability and
user-facing workflows—without destructive changes.

General rules
1. Use read-only exploration and create changes only in new files or clearly
   marked sections; never overwrite or delete existing code.
2. Run unit tests and lint checks to confirm nothing breaks; log results.
3. Stage changes but stop before committing; leave a summary in a new file
   named REPLIT_REPORT_06.md (increment if higher numbers exist).
4. Use minimal external resources; avoid network calls unless absolutely needed.

Tasks
A. Email verification redirect
   - File: `server/auth.ts` (around signup flow & verify handler)
   - Ensure the verification token is validated and successful links redirect
     to a user-friendly success page.
   - Update/add tests in `tests/unit/auth/email-verification-redirect.test.ts`.

B. Image generator “generation failed”
   - Files: `server/services/multi-ai-provider.ts`,
     `server/services/enhanced-ai-service.ts`
   - Check for missing env vars and unhandled errors; tighten logging.
   - Add tests under `tests/unit/image-generator/enhanced-ai-service.test.ts`
     covering success and failure paths.

C. ImageShield for receipt uploads
   - File: `server/expense-routes.ts` (receipt upload endpoint near lines ~146‑180)
   - Apply ImageShield scanning (`applyImageShieldProtection`) before storing
     receipts, mirroring logic from `server/routes/upload.ts`.
   - Create tests in `tests/unit/expenses/receipt-upload.test.ts` for allowed
     vs. blocked uploads.

D. Port binding resilience
   - File: `server/index.ts` (port setup near lines ~174‑183)
   - Confirm `PORT` env variable is respected and implement a graceful
     EADDRINUSE handler or fallback.
   - If needed, update `start.sh` to kill stray processes.

E. Documentation
   - File: `README.md`
   - Expand the environment‑variable section with `IMAGE_SHIELD_API_KEY`,
     `IMAGE_SHIELD_LEVEL`, and `PORT` usage examples.

Wrap-up
- Run lint and unit tests; record outputs in `REPLIT_REPORT_06.md`.
- Stage all new/modified files but do **not** commit.
- In the report, note completed tasks, skipped items, and next steps.
