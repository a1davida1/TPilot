ThottoPilot - Complete Application Audit & Fix Request
Context: ThottoPilot is a content creation platform for adult content creators that helps them generate AI-powered captions, protect images, schedule posts, and manage their social media presence across Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, and OnlyFans. The app uses React/TypeScript frontend, Express/Node backend, PostgreSQL database, and integrates with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) and third-party services (Stripe, SendGrid, Reddit OAuth).
Your Mission: Perform a complete audit and fix all issues to make this a production-ready SaaS application. Focus on security, performance, user experience, and code quality.

Redirect to /dashboard?reddit=connected not old dashboard
Add proper error handling for expired sessions

Critical Issue #2: Session Configuration
Location: server/routes.ts
Fix Required:

Session middleware must be initialized BEFORE auth routes
Set saveUninitialized: true for OAuth
Add Redis session store if REDIS_URL exists
Configure proper session secrets
Add TypeScript types for session properties

Critical Issue #3: Database Schema
Required Columns - Add if missing:
sqlALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reddit_username VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reddit_access_token TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reddit_refresh_token TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reddit_id VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_status VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_tier VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
