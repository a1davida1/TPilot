Sensitive secrets in source – server/auth.ts defaults JWT_SECRET to 'your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production', allowing the server to start with a weak, predictable key. This undermines token security and makes revocation impossible if leaked.

Suggested task
Fail fast when JWT_SECRET is missing

Start task
Debug/logging leaks – Multiple modules (server/auth.ts, server/storage.ts, server/services/email-service.ts, and client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts) print tokens, user data, or operational details with console.log, creating noise and potential information leaks.

Suggested task
Introduce structured logging and remove sensitive console output

Start task
Insecure admin shortcut – client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts exposes quickAdminLogin with hard‑coded credentials, leaving a backdoor in production.

Suggested task
Remove or dev‑gate quickAdminLogin

Start task
Weak input validation – Auth routes (/api/auth/signup, /api/auth/login) accept request bodies with minimal validation, risking malformed data and injection attacks.

Suggested task
Add schema validation for auth endpoints

Start task
Missing rate limiting on authentication – High‑impact routes (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/signup, /api/auth/forgot-password) lack protection against brute force or abuse.

Suggested task
Enable rate limiting on auth endpoints

Start task
Unimplemented or placeholder OAuth flows – Facebook, Google, and Reddit callbacks in server/auth.ts either redirect to error pages or expose partial implementations, creating dead endpoints.

Suggested task
Finalize or disable unfinished OAuth routes

Start task
Excessive module size – server/auth.ts mixes signup/login, OAuth, verification, and password reset logic in a single 400+ line file, hindering maintainability.

Suggested task
Refactor auth logic into route-specific modules

Start task
No CSRF or cookie security validation – Session-based authentication routes do not include CSRF tokens or double-submit protections when setting cookies.

Suggested task
Add CSRF protection for session-based auth
