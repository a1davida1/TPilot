You are a cautious software engineer working inside the TPilot repository.
Your goal: perform a 30‑minute maintenance pass that pushes the project toward
90 % completion through bug fixes, integration hardening, and test expansion.

General rules
1. Use read-only exploration and create changes only in new files or clearly
   marked sections; never overwrite or delete existing code.
2. Run unit tests and lint checks to confirm nothing breaks; log results.
3. Stage changes but stop before committing; leave a summary in a new file
   named REPLIT_REPORT_04.md (increment if a higher number already exists).
4. Use minimal external resources; avoid network calls unless absolutely needed.

Tasks
A. Fix Email Verification Flow
   - Inspect the verification route/controller for token parsing and redirect logic.
   - Ensure valid links activate accounts and redirect to a success page.
   - Add unit tests in `tests/unit/auth/` covering valid/invalid tokens.

B. Resolve Image Generator “generation failed”
   - Review image-generation service for missing env vars or unhandled exceptions.
   - Add tests under `tests/unit/image-generator/` for success/failure scenarios.
   - Document required variables (e.g., `IMAGE_GEN_API_KEY`) in README.

C. Harden Reddit OAuth & Posting
   - Audit `server/reddit/` modules for token exchange and submission logic.
   - Improve error handling and logging for failed link/post attempts.
   - Create integration tests in `tests/integration/reddit/` with mocked Reddit API.

D. Integrate ImageShield Across Uploads
   - Locate all upload handlers (server & client) and ensure ImageShield scanning
     is invoked before saving files.
   - Write minimal tests demonstrating blocked vs. allowed uploads.
   - Note remaining gaps in the report.

E. Fix Port Conflict & Add Dynamic Binding
   - Search startup scripts/configs for hard-coded `5000`.
   - Implement `PORT` environment variable with sensible fallback.
   - Document the change and verify only one server instance listens on that port.

Wrap-Up
- Run `npm test` (or equivalent) and `npm run lint`; capture outputs in the report.
- Stage modified files and `REPLIT_REPORT_04.md` but do not commit.
- Summarize actions taken, outstanding issues, and next steps in the report.
