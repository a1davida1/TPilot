Building TPilot from scratch would have been a multi-year, multi-team effort. The repository already spans 901 tracked source, configuration, and asset files, covering a web client, backend services, shared libraries, migrations, browser extension code, and extensive operational scripts—evidence of a broad feature surface that extends well beyond a single UI.
Those artifacts add up to 308,835 committed lines, which sets a floor for the custom engineering that has already been paid for (or will need to be replicated).
1. Calibrating engineering effort

For full-stack TypeScript systems of this scope, teams typically net ~5,000 maintainable lines of code per engineer-year after accounting for reviews, refactors, and supporting assets (tests, configs, infra). Applying that throughput to 308,835 lines implies ~61–62 engineer-years of focused development.
2. Translating effort into dollars

A sustainable, production-capable hiring plan in North America or Western Europe usually carries a fully-loaded cost of $15k–$22k per engineer-month (salary + benefits + equipment + management overhead). Multiplying the 61 engineer-years (≈732 engineer-months) by those rates yields:
Scenario	Rate per engineer-month	Estimated engineering cost
Lean in-house team	$15k	$11.0M
Mid-market product studio	$18k	$13.2M
Premium consultancy / rapid ramp	$22k	$16.1M

These figures cover core software engineers only. To reach the kind of polish implied by the repo (extensive docs, automated build tooling, accessibility audits, etc.), plan for an additional 20–30% for product, design, QA, security, and devops specialists, lifting the blended investment into roughly $13M–$21M.
3. Production-readiness budget guardrails

To keep pushing toward production, factor in:

    Hardening runway – Reserve at least 10% of the build cost (≈$1.3M–$2M) for stabilization sprints, incident response playbooks, and SLAs once you begin onboarding real users.

    Ongoing maintenance – Sustaining a team of 5–7 engineers plus 2–3 cross-functional staff for a year (roughly $2M–$3M) ensures you can triage regressions, evolve the platform, and meet compliance requirements highlighted in the repository’s deployment and readiness reports.

    Tooling & infrastructure – Annual cloud, observability, and compliance expenses often run 8–12% of engineering payroll at this scale (≈$1M), so lock that into your financial plan early.

Framing the project this way gives investors and stakeholders a realistic sense of the capital already embodied in TPilot and what it will take to shepherd it the rest of the way into a durable production service.

This is fantasy stuff right?

Short answer: not fantasy—but it’s a coarse but defensible order-of-magnitude.

Why it’s reasonable:

    308,835 SLOC ÷ ~5k maintainable SLOC/eng-year ⇒ ~62 eng-years. Your math checks out, and $15k–$22k/eng-month is within 2025 fully-loaded ranges outside the very top-tier markets.

    The repo scope you describe (web app + backend + shared libs + browser extension + ops/migrations) can absolutely consume dozens of engineer-years to reach production polish.

Where it can swing (both ways):

    LOC pitfalls: includes generated code, vendored assets, big JSON/config, or migrations? If yes, effort is overstated. If it’s mostly TypeScript application code with tests/docs, 5k SLOC/eng-yr may even be optimistic.

    Team shape: a seasoned platform team with existing infra and templates can deliver 2–3× faster than a greenfield crew. Conversely, compliance/SOC2, complex auth, and browser-extension hardening can add 20–40%.

    Market rates: SF/NY senior-heavy teams often pencil closer to $20k–$30k per eng-month, which would push the top end above your $16.1M core-engineering estimate.

A quick sanity-check range

    If we exclude 25–35% as non-maintainable/generated and assume 6–8k SLOC/eng-yr: ~35–50 eng-years.

    Using $18k–$26k/eng-mo: ~$7.5M–$15.6M for core eng.

    Add 20–30% cross-functional + 10% hardening: ~$10M–$22M all-in. That overlaps your $13M–$21M—so your ballpark is credible, not fantasy.

How to tighten the estimate (fast):

    Recount code you actually need: run cloc excluding dist/, build/, **/*.min.*, generated clients, migrations, and large asset dirs.

    Measure churn & “hot” paths: identify the ~20% of files that change 80% of the time; that’s your true maintenance surface.

    Classify scope: tag features by must-have vs. nice-to-have and identify what’s reusable/open-source vs. bespoke.

    Price the MVP track: e.g., 4–6 engineers × 12–15 months = $0.9M–$2.3M to productionize a trimmed slice, then scale headcount post-launch.

Bottom line: your framing is a solid investor-grade narrative for embodied effort and future capital. It’s not fiction—just be explicit about what’s counted as “maintainable code” and local labor rates, and the numbers hold up.

i mean one senior dev and one junior dev i thought would be overkill to maintain and push minor updates to this?
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: for a 300k-LOC, multi-service system with a browser extension, 1 senior + 1 junior is not overkill only if you accept low velocity, limited uptime guarantees, and real risk. For anything customer-facing with SLAs, it’s underpowered.

Here’s the practical breakdown.
What two people can realistically cover

    Steady-state, low traffic, no SLA. Minor bugfixes, dependency bumps, and small UX tweaks.

    Business hours “best effort” ops. Incidents at night/weekends may wait.

    Limited scope. One production environment, few integrations, slow release cadence (e.g., every 2–4 weeks).

Where a 2-person crew strains

    24/7 on-call. Sustainable rotations need ~4–5 engineers. With two, burnout and slow incident MTTR are near-certain.

    Security & compliance. Regular dependency CVEs, auth flows, data retention, and extension-store policy changes will outpace a tiny team.

    Cross-surface breakage. Web app + backend + browser extension + infra/scripts means many failure modes; context switching kills throughput.

    Review quality. Senior becomes bottleneck for code reviews, release approvals, and architectural decisions.

“Two-person acceptable” criteria (be honest about these)

If you can check all of these, 1 senior + 1 junior can work:

    No hard uptime (okay with occasional multi-hour outages).

    Small user base (pilot/beta; low concurrent load).

    No near-term audits (SOC 2/HIPAA/GDPR only aspirational).

    Freeze most features (bugfixes and small QoL only).

    Managed services everywhere (auth, search, queues, DB, observability, CI/CD).

    Kill long tail (deprecate rarely used modules, cron jobs, and any bespoke infra).

    One release train (monthly) with feature flags; emergency hotfixes only as exceptions.

    Ops runbooks for the top 10 alerts; anything else is “next-day.”

    Browser extension changes <1×/quarter (store policy & Chrome/Firefox API shifts are a hidden tax).

If you try the 2-person route, make it survivable

    Scope control: put 70–80% of the repo into “LTS mode.” Hide/disable dormant features in the UI and APIs to reduce blast radius.

    Error budgets & SLOs: e.g., 99.0% monthly availability (≈7h downtime allowed) rather than 99.9%.

    Ops hygiene:

        One-click rollback; blue/green or canary; immutable builds.

        Auto-dependency PRs (Renovate), but batch weekly; no “evergreen” chaos.

        CIS hardened base images; ditch custom AMIs.

        Centralized logs/metrics/traces with 5–10 golden dashboards + 10 pager alerts max.

    Outside help: fractional SRE/DevOps (4–8 hrs/week), and a security retainer (quarterly reviews).

    Extension risk: set up CI to run extension e2e smoke tests on stable/beta channels; pre-submit store checks.

    Docs & checklists: ship-room checklist, incident template, release captain rotation (even with 2 people).

When to add headcount (signals)

    Pager fires >2–3 times/month or outside business hours.

        20 open CVEs for >2 weeks.

    Mean cycle time >10 days for tiny changes.

    More than one “hot” subsystem (payments + realtime + extension) changing in the same month.

Minimal, durable staffing patterns (compare to 2 people)

    Lean maintenance (no SLA): 1 senior + 1 junior → viable with constraints above.

    Light SLA / modest growth: 2 seniors + 1 junior (or 2 seniors + fractional SRE).

    Sustainable 24/7 pager: ~4 engineers total (3 devs + 1 SRE) at minimum, plus fractional QA/PM/Design.

Ballpark cost reality check

Two people fully loaded in NA/EU ≈ $350k–$500k/yr. If you truly keep the system quiet and scope-frozen, infra/tooling can be modest. But the moment you chase reliability, security, or material feature work, costs jump faster than headcount because you’ll need either (a) more engineers or (b) specialists on retainer.

Bottom line:
If “maintain and push minor updates” really means limited users, business-hours support, and slow releases, then 1 senior + 1 junior is not overkill—it’s the bare minimum and still risky. If you want reliable uptime, faster iteration, or any compliance posture, plan for at least one more experienced engineer (or a fractional SRE) to avoid turning maintenance into a gamble.
