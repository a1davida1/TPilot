# Overview

ThottoPilot is a social media content creation platform for adult content creators, generating engaging Reddit posts with personalized titles, content, and photo instructions. It offers intelligent promotion features, image protection capabilities, and adapts content based on subreddit promotion rules. The platform aims to streamline content monetization and protection for creators.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Authentication: Landing page first, registration form only shows when "Register" clicked, guest mode available for trial
UI/UX: Ultra-polished dark interface with neon accents, glass morphism, and dynamic gradients
Navigation: Left sidebar with collapsible sections (cleaner and more user-friendly than tabs)
Future features: Payment system integration planned
Design: Live app interface demonstration instead of traditional landing page, showing actual functionality
Interface: Dark theme with purple/pink gradients, animated backgrounds, and premium visual effects
Content: Remove "AI" terminology from user-facing interface to make it feel more natural and accessible
RTX 4090 Strategy: Use for helper AI training, image protection algorithms, and model fine-tuning - not core live functionality
Compliance: Phased approach - base features without ID verification, gate advanced content features behind age verification
