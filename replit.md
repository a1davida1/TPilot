# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Authentication: Landing page first, registration form only shows when "Register" clicked, guest mode available for trial
UI/UX: Ultra-polished dark interface with neon accents, glass morphism, and dynamic gradients
Navigation: Left sidebar with collapsible sections (cleaner and more user-friendly than tabs)
Future features: Payment system integration planned
Design: Live app interface demonstration instead of traditional landing page, showing actual functionality
Interface: Dark theme with purple/pink gradients, animated backgrounds, and premium visual effects
Content: Remove "AI" terminology from user-facing interface to make it feel more natural and accessible
RTX 4090 Strategy: Use for helper AI training, image protection algorithms, and model fine-tuning - not core live functionality
