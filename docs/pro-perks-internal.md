## Operating Checklist

- **Partner outreach** – collect AM contacts and verify ToS for every live perk.  
- **Bonus negotiation** – always chase the “TPilot Negotiation Target” column before public launch.  
- **Data sync** – backfill missing `officialLink` URLs in `server/pro-perks.ts` as contracts close.  
- **Doc maintenance** – revisit this playbook whenever terms shift or new partners go live.

## Revenue Modelling Snapshot

Assumes the `/pro-perks` page (now live for all users) drives adoption at scale.

### Core Assumptions

- Residual mix: 32 of 39 live perks pay recurring revenue; the rest are CPA/one-time.  
- Adoption: 60% of engaged users activate a residual perk, the rest try CPA offers (education-driven).  
- Yield per engaged user: residual perks average $220–$250/month; CPA offers $90–$100/month.  
- Platform override: currently modeled at $0 until revshare contracts define our take-rate.  
- Churn: engaged perk users churn ~30% less MoM; overall churn drop scales with adoption share.

### Scenario Summary

| Active Users | Residual Adopters | CPA Adopters | Residual Revenue | CPA Revenue | Total Creator Payout | Est. Churn Reduction |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 500 | 75 (15%) | 25 (5%) | $16,500 | $2,250 | **$18,750** | ≈ 4–5% absolute drop |
| 1,000 | 200 (20%) | 80 (8%) | $46,000 | $7,600 | **$53,600** | ≈ 8–9% absolute drop |
| 5,000 | 1,400 (28%) | 600 (12%) | $350,000 | $60,000 | **$410,000** | ≈ 12–13% absolute drop |

### Interpretation

- **Cash-flow sensitivity** – every +5 percentage-point increase in residual adoption shifts payouts by ~$55 per activated user.  
- **Retention flywheel** – if baseline churn is 12% MoM, the 5,000-user case moves churn toward 10.4%, extending lifetime value by ~1.6 months.  
- **Next steps** – instrument `/api/pro-resources` events (telemetry now live) and refresh these numbers quarterly.
