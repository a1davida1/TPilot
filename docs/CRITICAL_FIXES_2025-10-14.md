# Critical Production Fixes - October 14, 2025

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### 1. Catbox Upload Blocked by CSP
**Problem**: Content Security Policy was blocking direct uploads to Catbox
```
Content-Security-Policy blocked https://catbox.moe/user/api.php
```

**Solution**: Added Catbox domains to CSP in `/server/middleware/security.ts`
```javascript
connectSrc: [
  "'self'",
  "https://catbox.moe",          // Direct upload endpoint
  "https://files.catbox.moe",    // Image serving domain
  // ... other domains
]
```

### 2. Referral Endpoint 404 Error
**Problem**: Client was calling wrong endpoint `/api/referral/my-code`

**Solution**: Fixed endpoint in `/client/src/components/ReferralWidget.tsx`
```javascript
// Old: '/api/referral/my-code'
// New: '/api/referral/code'
```

### 3. CSRF Token for Reddit Posting
**Problem**: Reddit posts failing with "Invalid CSRF token"

**Solution**: Already fixed in `/client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - now always includes CSRF for state-changing requests

## 🚀 Deploy These Fixes NOW

```bash
# 1. Build the application
npm run build

# 2. Commit and push to production
git add .
git commit -m "Critical: Fix CSP for Catbox uploads + referral endpoint"
git push origin main

# 3. Render will auto-deploy
```

## ✅ After Deployment

Users must:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Refresh the page**

Then test:
- ✅ Catbox uploads should work
- ✅ Reddit posting should work
- ✅ Referral widget should load without errors
