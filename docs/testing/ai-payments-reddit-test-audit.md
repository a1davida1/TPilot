# AI, Payments, and Reddit Flow Test Audit

## Scope & Methodology
- Reviewed Vitest suites under `tests/unit`, `tests/routes`, and `tests/integration` with focus on AI generation, payments, and Reddit features.
- Mapped automated coverage against critical user journeys and failure modes called out in product requirements (ImageShield enforcement, payment resilience, Reddit compliance).
- Highlighted explicit coverage, inferred protections (shared helpers/mock usage), and verified gaps requiring follow-up work.

## AI Generation Coverage

### Existing Tests
- **Caption pipelines (`tests/unit/caption/*`, `tests/routes/caption-generation.test.ts`)** – cover OpenAI/Gemini fallbacks, NSFW guards, prompt sanitization, and provider escalation logic.
- **Image generator services (`tests/unit/image-generator/*`)** – validate provider availability matrix, prioritization heuristics, and handling of upstream outages.
- **Advanced generator integration (`tests/unit/server/advanced-content-generator.test.ts`)** – exercises authenticity scoring and Reddit-specific tone adjustments.

### Gaps Identified
- **Next API surface** – no automated coverage for App Router endpoints; new `app/api/ai/generate` route added in this change set now carries dedicated integration tests.
- **ImageShield enforcement** – unit tests do not assert watermark + compression guarantees before storage; requires targeted checks around `server/image-caption-generator.ts` + storage adapters.
- **Rate limiting / abuse controls** – existing suites do not simulate repeated generation attempts to ensure throttling kicks in (important for protecting AI budgets).

## Payments Coverage

### Existing Tests
- **Provider factories (`tests/unit/payment-providers*.test.ts`)** – verify checkout URL building, webhook stubs, and fallback behavior when secrets are missing.
- **Billing flow integrations (`tests/integration/billing-flow.test.ts`)** – confirm REST endpoints surface available providers and handle provider failures gracefully.
- **Visitor analytics (`tests/unit/visitor-analytics.test.ts`)** – asserts payment events update analytics counters.

### Gaps Identified
- **Next API coverage** – no tests for payments App Router endpoints until this update introduced `app/api/payments/providers` with integration coverage.
- **High-risk merchant edge cases** – missing regression tests for CCBill/Crypto compliance rules (multi-currency tax reporting, enhanced KYB checks).
- **Webhook verification** – unit suites cover provider stubs but not actual signature validation paths; need end-to-end mocks for Paxum/Coinbase callbacks.

## Reddit Flow Coverage

### Existing Tests
- **OAuth connection (`tests/routes/reddit-oauth-ip.test.ts`)** – exercises secure state handling, IP mismatch warnings, and queue parameter validation.
- **Posting guardrails (`tests/unit/server/reddit-manager.can-post.test.ts`, `tests/integration/reddit/posting-flow.test.ts`)** – validate repost detection, flair requirements, and submission success/failure states.
- **Intelligence dashboards (`tests/routes/redditIntelligence.test.ts`, `tests/unit/server/lib/analytics-service.test.ts`)** – ensure analytics endpoints respect query filters and caching.

### Gaps Identified
- **App Router bridge** – no coverage for Next-based OAuth bootstrap; addressed by new `app/api/reddit/connect` handler tests that assert secure state persistence.
- **Rate limiting persistence** – existing tests mock in-memory store; need integration coverage once Redis-backed limiter is enabled.
- **Rule cache freshness** – tests don't confirm 24-hour subreddit rule caching requirements; follow-up should target `server/reddit-communities.ts` caching paths.

## Follow-Up Recommendations
1. **Extend ImageShield + storage tests** to guarantee no raw assets persist past processing.
2. **Add payment webhook signature suites** using recorded fixtures from Paxum/Coinbase sandbox environments.
3. **Back the Reddit state store with Redis in tests** to mirror production expiry semantics and rate limiting windows.
4. **Exercise API throttling** (AI + Reddit posting) using high-volume simulation tests to protect against abusive automation.
