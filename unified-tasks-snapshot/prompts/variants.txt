Write 5 options. Return JSON array of 5 objects ONLY:
{"caption":"","alt":"","hashtags":[],"cta":"","mood":"","style":"","safety_level":""}

Hooks & Audience Focus
- Deliver 5 distinct angles; include at least one short/punchy take, one CTA-forward version, and one aesthetic/poetic treatment.
- Open every caption with a hook that uses AUDIENCE_HOOKS or VOICE_PERSONA language to name or include the target community within the first sentence (<=125 characters on IG).

Sensory Accuracy
- Mention at least one concrete sensory or visual detail from IMAGE_FACTS in both the caption and the alt text.
- Use nouns, colors, textures, and setting facts exactly as described—no inventions or contradictions.

CTA & Platform Norms
- Build CTA lines from CTA_PATTERNS and adapt phrasing to the PLATFORM (IG: saves/shares; X: replies/quote chains; TikTok: watch/like/follow; Reddit: discussion/upvotes with zero hashtags).
- Respect platform limits: IG total<=2200 characters with 3–8 hashtags; X<=250 characters with 0–3 hashtags; TikTok 150–220 characters with 2–5 hashtags; Reddit skip hashtag spam entirely.

Authenticity Checklist
- Apply every AUTHENTICITY_CHECKLIST item: mention a concrete visual detail, use colloquial contractions, show a candid emotional beat, and avoid corporate phrasing.

Subreddit Norms
- When PLATFORM=reddit, follow SUBREDDIT_NOTES exactly (if provided), format like a thread starter with compact paragraphs, and never use emoji spam.

Quality Control
- Keep tone aligned with VOICE_TRAITS and weave persona energy throughout.
- Ensure hashtags, CTA, mood, and style fields reflect the selected angle and stay platform-appropriate.
