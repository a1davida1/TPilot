# Fix for Production Email Delivery on thottopilot.com

## The Problem

Emails work in the **production preview** but not in the **deployed environment**. This is because Replit handles secrets differently between these environments:

- **Production Preview**: Uses workspace secrets (working ‚úÖ)
- **Deployed Site (thottopilot.com)**: Needs deployment-specific secrets (not configured ‚ùå)

## The Solution

You need to add secrets specifically to your deployment, not just to your workspace.

### Step 1: Open Your Deployment Settings

1. In your Replit workspace, click on the **Deploy** button
2. Find your existing deployment for thottopilot.com
3. Click on your deployment to open its settings

### Step 2: Add Deployment Secrets

In the deployment settings, look for **"Secrets"** or **"Environment Variables"** section and add:

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY = [Your SendGrid API Key]
FROM_EMAIL = support@thottopilot.com
JWT_SECRET = [Your JWT Secret]
FRONTEND_URL = https://thottopilot.com
```

**Important**: These must be added as **Deployment Secrets**, not just workspace secrets.

### Step 3: Redeploy Your Application

After adding the secrets:
1. Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Update Deployment"**
2. Wait for the deployment to complete
3. Emails should now work on thottopilot.com

## How to Verify It's Working

1. **Check deployment logs**: The app now logs whether it's running in DEPLOYED mode
   - Look for: "üöÄ Running in DEPLOYED environment"
   - Should show: "üìß Email config - SENDGRID_API_KEY exists: true"

2. **Test password reset**: Try the password reset flow on thottopilot.com

3. **Monitor SendGrid**: Check your SendGrid dashboard for email activity

## Why This Happens

Replit separates workspace secrets from deployment secrets for security:
- **Workspace secrets**: Available during development and preview
- **Deployment secrets**: Must be explicitly configured for production

This prevents accidental exposure of development secrets in production and allows different configurations for each environment.

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Deployment secrets added (not just workspace secrets)
- [ ] SENDGRID_API_KEY is set in deployment
- [ ] FROM_EMAIL is verified in SendGrid
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is set for password reset tokens
- [ ] FRONTEND_URL is set to https://thottopilot.com
- [ ] Redeployed after adding secrets

## Additional Notes

- The diagnostic logging will show "REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT=1" when running in deployed mode
- If emails still don't work after this, check SendGrid logs for blocked sender verification
