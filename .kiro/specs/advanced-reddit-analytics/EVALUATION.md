# Requirements Evaluation & Proposed Changes

## Proposed Additions from Technical Analysis

### 1. **Hybrid Snoowrap + Axios Architecture** ‚úÖ ADD
**Why:** 12-15x performance improvement for data fetching
**Impact:** Critical for user experience (30s vs 120s sync time)
**Where:** Add to Technical Architecture section in requirements
**Effort:** 0h (architectural decision, not implementation)

**Benefits:**
- Quick sync: 100 posts in 8s (vs 120s with pure Snoowrap)
- Subreddit info: 0.5s (vs 3s)
- OAuth handled automatically by Snoowrap
- Redis caching built-in

**Decision:** ‚úÖ **KEEP - Add to requirements as technical constraint**

---

### 2. **Security & Encryption** ‚úÖ ADD (but defer implementation)
**Why:** Production requirement for handling Reddit tokens
**Impact:** Critical for security, GDPR compliance
**Where:** Add as new requirement "SECURITY-1"
**Effort:** 3-4h implementation

**Components:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption for Reddit tokens
- JWT authentication (already exists)
- Rate limiting per user (100 req/min)
- HTTPS enforcement

**Decision:** ‚úÖ **ADD to requirements, DEFER to Phase 4 (post-MVP)**
- Reason: Not blocking for analytics features
- Current: Tokens stored in plaintext (acceptable for beta)
- Production: Must encrypt before public launch

---

### 3. **BullMQ Worker Queue** ‚úÖ ADD (already using Bull)
**Why:** Handle concurrent syncs, prevent Reddit API rate limits
**Impact:** Scalability for 1K+ users
**Where:** Add to Technical Architecture
**Effort:** 2-3h (Bull already configured, just need sync worker)

**Benefits:**
- Queue deep syncs to prevent API overload
- Progress tracking for users
- Retry logic for failed syncs
- Concurrency control (5 syncs at once)

**Decision:** ‚úÖ **KEEP - Add as part of MISSING-0 (Auto-Sync)**
- Already using Bull for scheduled posts
- Just need to add sync worker

---

### 4. **Scalability Infrastructure Plan** ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFER
**Why:** Planning for 1K users
**Impact:** Important but not immediate
**Where:** Move to separate "SCALABILITY.md" document
**Effort:** 4-6h setup

**Components:**
- Render service sizing ($90/mo for 1K users)
- Redis caching strategy
- Database optimization
- Worker process scaling

**Decision:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEFER to separate document**
- Reason: Not a feature requirement
- Better suited for infrastructure/deployment docs
- Can scale incrementally as user base grows

---

## Proposed Trims/Consolidations

### 1. **QW-5: Best Time Badge System** ‚ö†Ô∏è CONSOLIDATE
**Current:** Separate feature (1.5-2h)
**Proposal:** Merge into QW-9 (Engagement Heatmap)
**Reason:** Duplicate functionality - heatmap shows same data visually

**Decision:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONSOLIDATE into QW-9**
- Keep badges as part of heatmap UI
- Remove as standalone feature
- Saves 1.5-2h development time

---

### 2. **ML-5: Automated A/B Testing** ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFER
**Current:** Phase 5 (14-18h)
**Proposal:** Move to "Future Enhancements"
**Reason:** Complex, requires significant user data, low immediate ROI

**Decision:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEFER to v2.0**
- Requires 100+ posts per user to be meaningful
- Complex UX (users need to understand experiments)
- Better to focus on core analytics first

---

### 3. **Req 6: Competitor Benchmarking** ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFER
**Current:** Phase 4 (14-18h)
**Proposal:** Move to Phase 5 or v2.0
**Reason:** Privacy concerns, complex implementation, lower impact (72/100)

**Decision:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEFER to Phase 5**
- Not critical for MVP
- Requires significant user base for meaningful benchmarks
- Privacy implications need careful consideration

---

### 4. **Req 10: Mobile Optimization** ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFER
**Current:** Phase 4 (5-7h)
**Proposal:** Move to Phase 5 (polish phase)
**Reason:** Tailwind is already responsive, just needs testing/refinement

**Decision:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEFER to Phase 5**
- Existing Tailwind classes provide basic responsiveness
- Can launch with "works on mobile" vs "optimized for mobile"
- Polish after core features complete

---
