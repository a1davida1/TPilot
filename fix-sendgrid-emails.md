# Fix SendGrid Email Delivery Issues

## The Problem
Your password reset emails are being accepted by SendGrid (202 status) but not delivered to recipients. This is because the FROM email address (noreply@thottopilot.com) is not properly verified in SendGrid.

## Quick Fix Solutions

### Option 1: Use Single Sender Verification (Fastest - 5 minutes)
1. Log into SendGrid: https://app.sendgrid.com
2. Go to Settings → Sender Authentication → Single Sender Verification
3. Click "Create New Sender"
4. Enter these details:
   - From Name: ThottoPilot
   - From Email: Use an email you control (e.g., your personal Gmail)
   - Reply To: Same as From Email
   - Company Address: Your business address
5. Click "Create" and check your email for verification
6. Once verified, update your Replit Secrets:
   - Set `FROM_EMAIL` to the verified email address

### Option 2: Authenticate Your Domain (Best for Production - 30 minutes)
1. Log into SendGrid: https://app.sendgrid.com
2. Go to Settings → Sender Authentication → Authenticate Your Domain
3. Select your DNS provider (or "I'm not sure")
4. Enter "thottopilot.com" as your domain
5. SendGrid will provide CNAME records to add to your DNS
6. Add these records to your domain's DNS settings
7. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)
8. Click "Verify" in SendGrid
9. Once verified, any email @thottopilot.com will work

## Test Your Configuration

Run this command in your Replit Shell to test email sending:
```bash
node test-sendgrid-email.js your-email@example.com
```

This will try different FROM addresses and tell you which one works.

## Update Environment Variables

Once you have a working FROM email, update your Replit Secrets:
1. Go to Secrets in Replit
2. Update `FROM_EMAIL` with the verified email
3. Restart your application

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "The from address does not match a verified Sender Identity"
- **Solution**: Complete Single Sender Verification (Option 1 above)

### "Domain authentication is not verified"  
- **Solution**: Complete domain authentication or use Single Sender Verification

### "Bounce or spam reports"
- **Solution**: Check SendGrid dashboard for suppression list and remove test emails

### Still Not Working?
1. Check SendGrid Activity Feed: https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
2. Look for your test emails and check their status
3. Review any error messages or bounce reasons
