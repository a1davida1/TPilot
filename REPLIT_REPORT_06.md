## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **ImageShield Receipt Protection**
```typescript
// Multi-tier protection with user-based configuration
const protectionLevel = req.body.protectionLevel || 'light';
const addWatermark = ['free', 'starter'].includes(userTier);

// Server-side Sharp.js processing
- Gaussian blur: 0.3-0.8 intensity
- Noise injection: 3-8 level  
- Intelligent resize: 98%-90% scaling
- Quality adjustment: 95%-88%
- Conditional watermarking for free users
```

### **AI Service Resilience Architecture**
```typescript
// Environment validation + graceful fallbacks
1. Validate API keys on service initialization
2. Primary: Google Gemini with rate limiting
3. Fallback: OpenAI GPT-4o with error recovery
4. Emergency: Template-based content generation
5. Comprehensive error logging and debugging
```

### **Port Binding Enhancement**
```typescript
// EADDRINUSE handling with Replit compatibility
1. Read PORT environment variable (5000 default)
2. Attempt binding with 3 retry attempts
3. 2-second delays between retries
4. Graceful error messaging and process management
5. Maintains Replit firewall compliance
```
