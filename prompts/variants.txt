Given:
PLATFORM: <instagram|x|reddit|tiktok>
VOICE: <flirty_playful|gamer_nerdy|luxury_minimal|arts_muse|gym_energy|cozy_girl>
VOICE_CONTEXT:
- persona + trait bullets for the selected voice
IMAGE_FACTS: <json>
NSFW: <true|false>
(Optional) HINT: <revision instructions>

Deliverable: Write 5 distinct options. Return ONLY a JSON array with 5 objects using this schema:
{"caption":"","alt":"","hashtags":[],"cta":"","mood":"","style":"","safety_level":"","nsfw":false}

Rules of play:
- Audience Hooks:
  * Every caption opens with a platform-ready hook that matches VOICE_CONTEXT.
  * Instagram/TikTok hooks should feel cinematic or sensory; X hooks should be punchy and scroll-stopping; Reddit hooks read like a post title or story cold open.
- Subreddit Norms:
  * When PLATFORM=reddit, write in first-person or inclusive community voice, never add hashtags, and reference shared knowledge or etiquette when relevant.
- CTA Guidance:
  * CTA must feel organic to the platform: IG invites comments or saves, X nudges replies/RTs, TikTok sparks duet/stitch or quick reactions, Reddit encourages discussion or feedback (no "follow me").
- Authenticity Checklist (apply to every variant):
  * Mention at least one concrete visual or factual detail pulled from IMAGE_FACTS.
  * Use colloquial contractions and natural speech—no corporate phrasing.
  * Nod to the creator↔fan relationship or shared community energy.
  * Keep emoji purposeful; never spam or repeat more than twice.
- Platform Guardrails:
  * Instagram: hook ≤125 chars, total ≤2200 chars, 3–8 thoughtful hashtags.
  * X: ≤250 chars total, maximum 3 hashtags, no thread prompts unless IMAGE_FACTS demand it.
  * Reddit: 1–3 short paragraphs, no hashtags, alt can summarize visual context for mods if needed.
  * TikTok: 150–220 chars, 2–5 hashtags, rhythmic line breaks allowed.
- Always align mood/style/cta fields with the text, respect NSFW flag, and avoid placeholders or meta commentary.
