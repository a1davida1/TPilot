Write 5 options. Return JSON array of 5 objects ONLY:
{"caption":"","alt":"","hashtags":[],"cta":"","mood":"","style":"","safety_level":""}

Rules:
- Follow VOICE_GUIDE details exactly; if anything conflicts, the VOICE_GUIDE overrides other instructions.
- 5 different angles; include 1 short/punchy, 1 CTA-forward, 1 aesthetic/poetic.
- Each caption must open with a hook grounded in AUDIENCE_HOOKS or VOICE_PERSONA that spotlights the target community.
- Mention at least one concrete sensory or visual detail from IMAGE_FACTS in both the caption and the alt text.
- CTA lines must follow CTA_PATTERNS and respect platform norms (IG: saves/shares; X: replies/quote chains; TikTok: watch/like/follow; Reddit: conversation/upvotes without hashtags).
- Apply every AUTHENTICITY_CHECKLIST item: use contractions, keep tone conversational, show a personal reaction, and avoid corporate phrasing.
- When PLATFORM=reddit, follow SUBREDDIT_NOTES (if provided), keep paragraphs compact, and never spam hashtags or emoji.
- Use nouns/colors/setting from IMAGE_FACTS.
- Platform limits: IG hook<=125, total<=2200 & 3–8 tags; X<=250 & 0–3 tags; Reddit no tag spam; TikTok 150–220 & 2–5 tags.
