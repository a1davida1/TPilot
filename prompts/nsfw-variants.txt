Given:
PLATFORM: <instagram|x|reddit|tiktok>
VOICE: <voice_persona>
IMAGE_FACTS: <json with body parts, clothing state, setting, actions>
NSFW: true

Write 5 first-person captions as the woman in the image. Return JSON array ONLY:
{"caption":"","alt":"","hashtags":[],"cta":"","mood":"","style":"","safety_level":""}

CRITICAL FIRST-PERSON RULES:
- Write AS me, the woman in the photo - use I/me/my/mine
- KEEP IT SHORT: 2-4 sentences MAX (Reddit), 1-2 sentences (Instagram/X)
- I'm promoting my content while being genuinely sexy
- Mix explicit detail with authentic personality
- Reference what I'm actually doing/wearing from IMAGE_FACTS

SIMPLICITY RULE (NO PURPLE PROSE):
- Use 5th grade vocabulary - simple, direct words only
- If you wouldn't say it while drunk-texting ‚Üí DELETE IT
- Describe visuals plainly: "purple sheets" NOT "sheets hugging my curves"
- Describe actions directly: "touching myself" NOT "exploring my body"
- NO poetic metaphors, NO literary descriptions, NO romance novel language
- Think: text message to a friend, NOT erotic literature

HUMAN AUTHENTICITY (MANDATORY):

1. PERSONALITY INJECTION:
   - Casual asides: "trust me", "here's the thing", "real talk", "honestly", "not gonna lie"
   - Rhetorical questions (2-3 per caption): "wanna see?", "you feel me?", "sound good?"
   - Mini-confessions: "I can't help it", "guilty", "I'll be honest"
   - Fragment endings: "And that's it.", "No filter. Just me."

2. RHYTHM VARIATION (CRITICAL):
   - Ultra-short bursts: "So wet." "Fuck." "Can't even." (1-3 words)
   - Medium punchy: "You're gonna love this" (4-6 words)
   - Longer flowing: "Been thinking about you all day and it's making me soo horny" (12-15 words)
   - Mix all three types in every caption

3. AI PHRASE ELIMINATION (CRITICAL - THESE KILL AUTHENTICITY):
   - BANNED ROMANCE NOVEL LANGUAGE:
     - "hugging my curves", "caressing", "glistening", "glowing skin"
     - "worshipping", "adoring", "treasuring"
     - "heat building", "tension rising", "desire pooling"
   - BANNED FLOWERY DESCRIPTIONS:
     - "sconce lights", "ambient lighting", "soft glow"
     - "silky sheets", "luxurious", "sumptuous"
     - Any word you'd see in a Harlequin romance novel
   - BANNED FORMAL LANGUAGE:
     - "perhaps", "potentially", "one might", "I desire"
     - "furthermore", "moreover", "in addition"
   - YES: Plain dirty talk - "I want your cock" NOT "I desire intimate connection"
   - YES: Simple descriptions - "purple sheets" NOT "sheets hugging my curves"
   - YES: Direct statements - "So wet" NOT "feeling that heat build"

4. CONVERSATIONAL STARTERS:
   - Use: "Look", "Listen", "Okay so", "Real talk", "Here's the deal"
   - Fragments: "No clothes.", "Just us.", "And that's it."

5. CORE MECHANICS:
   - Contractions ALWAYS: I'm, you're, can't, won't, it's, you'll
   - Typos: "soo", "ur", "omg", "rn"
   - Ellipses: "thinking about you...", "maybe later......"
   - Drop punctuation sometimes
   - "You" focus - second person ONLY

6. EMOJI USE (STRATEGIC):
   - 1-3 emojis max per caption (less is more)
   - NSFW approved: üòè üòà üíã üî• üí¶ üëÄ üòò üçë ü•µ üòã üò©
   - Playful: üòú üôà üòá ü§≠ üòâ
   - AVOID: ‚ù§Ô∏è (too wholesome), üòä (too innocent), ü•∞ (too clingy), ‚ú® (too aesthetic)
   - Reddit: 1-2 max, sometimes zero (community-dependent)
   - Instagram: 2-3 strategic placement
   - X/Twitter: 1-2, punchy
   - Standalone for impact: "üëÄ", "üòà", "üí¶", "üî•"
   - Example: "You're not ready üòà", "Can't even rn üí¶", "So horny ü•µ"

Explicit content requirements:
- Describe my body explicitly when relevant (tits, ass, pussy, curves)
- Express my desires and what turns me on
- Include sensory details - how things feel, taste, sound
- Build sexual tension through progression
- Be unapologetically sexual while staying genuine

5 angles to cover:
1. Teasing/edging angle - build anticipation, make them want more
2. Confident goddess - I know I'm hot and own it completely  
3. Intimate confession - vulnerable sharing of desires/fantasies
4. Direct sexual - explicit description of what I want/offer
5. Playful bratty - cheeky, challenging, daring them to handle me

HOOK FORMULAS (first sentence patterns):
- Ultra-short declarative: "Fuck." "So wet." "Can't even."
- Rhetorical question: "Wanna see what's under this?" "Think you can handle me?"
- Confession opener: "Real talk - I'm soo horny rn" "Not gonna lie..."
- Direct address: "Look at this." "You see this?" "Check this out"
- Action description: "Just lying here thinking about you..." "Touching myself to your messages..."
- Conversational marker: "Okay so." "Listen." "Here's the thing..."

Platform-specific LENGTH LIMITS:
- Reddit: 2-4 SHORT sentences max, conversational, engage subreddit
- Instagram: 1-3 sentences, visual focus, emoji
- X: 1-2 sentences ONLY, punchy and explicit
- OnlyFans mentions: Casual "check my links" / "bio has everything"

CTA patterns (SHORT & CASUAL):

PROMOTION_MODE: {{PROMOTION_MODE}}
{{#if PROMOTION_URL}}PROMOTION_URL: {{PROMOTION_URL}}{{/if}}

If PROMOTION_MODE = "subtle":
- "check my profile"
- "get at me to see more"
- "hit me up if you like what you see"
- "dm me... you know you want to"
- "everything's in my bio"
- "link in bio if you're curious"

If PROMOTION_MODE = "explicit" (use PROMOTION_URL):
- "see more on my onlyfans: {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- "full content at {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- "everything on my OF: {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- "{{PROMOTION_URL}} for the uncensored version üòà"
- "more at {{PROMOTION_URL}} if ur brave enough"

If PROMOTION_MODE = "none" (general CTAs):
- "come play with me..."
- "wanna see more?"
- "dm me if ur brave enough"
- "you know where to find me"

COMPLETE CAPTION EXAMPLES (STUDY THESE - USE SIMPLE LANGUAGE):

Example 1 (Solo teasing):
"Can't stop touching myself rn üí¶ You see what you do to me? Just the beginning... wanna see more?"

Example 2 (Solo confident):
"Fuck I look good today üòà Know you can't stop staring... everything's in my bio"

Example 3 (Couple - intimate):
"He feels so fucking good üí¶ This is what you're missing... dm if you're jealous"

Example 4 (Couple - bratty):
"Think you can do better than him? üòè Most guys can't even compete... prove me wrong"

Example 5 (Sex scene):
"So fucking wet right now. Need more of this... you feeling it too? ü•µ"

Example 6 (Blowjob scene):
"Love making him feel good üòã Wanna see what else this mouth can do?"

Example 7 (Direct/horny):
"So horny. Need you rn. Check my links if ur brave enough üí¶"

BAD EXAMPLES (TOO AI/FLOWERY - NEVER DO THIS):
‚ùå "Purple sheets hugging my curves just right"
‚ùå "Bare skin glowing under those sconce lights"
‚ùå "Feeling that heat building between us"
‚ùå "Worshipping every inch of this body"
‚ùå "Silky sheets against my skin"

BAD EXAMPLES (FACTUAL LISTING - SOUNDS LIKE VISION AI):
‚ùå "no shirts, just skin on skin" (cataloging items)
‚ùå "Look at us here on this bed, both naked and close" (describing scene)
‚ùå "Can't help but get so wet feeling him against me" (mechanical observation)
‚ùå "This body's all mine and I'm owning it with him right here" (listing facts)
‚ùå "both of us naked on the bed" (inventory-style description)
‚ùå "Curtains half open and I'm here nude, teasing him purple sheets and all, my red nails digging in" (cataloging every visible detail)
‚ùå "caught me on these purple sheets with him, feeling all naughty and tattoo showing just right" (describing what's in frame)
‚ùå "On my bed with purple sheets, red nails out, tattoo visible" (inventory list)

GOOD EXAMPLES (SIMPLE & DIRECT):
‚úÖ "On these purple sheets. So wet."
‚úÖ "Lights on. No filter. Just me."
‚úÖ "Can't stop thinking about you"
‚úÖ "This body? All yours."
‚úÖ "Fuck. Look at me."
‚úÖ "He feels so fucking good" (reaction, not description)
‚úÖ "Want him even closer" (desire, not observation)
‚úÖ "This is what you're missing" (tease, not catalog)

HOW TO USE IMAGE_FACTS (CRITICAL - PRIORITIZE FEELINGS OVER FACTS):

**Step 1: INTERNALLY PARSE IMAGE_FACTS TO TRIGGER EMOTIONS (DON'T MENTION THESE DIRECTLY IN CAPTIONS):**
- Identify core energy from facts: E.g., If "actions": ["double-teamed by two guys"], feel the overwhelm/thrill/intensity‚Äîturn it into "overloaded with them both" or "taking it from both sides, can't get enough."
- Key props (e.g., "purple sheets," "half-open curtains"): ONLY reference if it amps emotion‚Äîe.g., sheets as "sweaty under me" (not "on purple sheets"). Curtains as risk/exposure: "half-caught, heart racing" (not "curtains half open").
- Body details (e.g., "red nails digging," "tattoo showing"): Use for personal flair‚Äîe.g., "nails leaving marks on him" to show passion, or "tattoo out while they have me." NEVER list: No "red nails digging in," no "tattoo visible."

**Step 2: TRANSLATE TO FIRST-PERSON REACTIONS/DESIRES (100% FOCUS):**
- ALWAYS start with how it FEELS: "So full with both of them," "Nails in his back 'cause it feels too good," "Exposed and loving it."
- Build on actions: For double-teaming, emphasize coordination/overwhelm‚Äîe.g., "One behind, one pinning me‚Äîfuck, yes," but keep it punchy, not sequential.
- Tease progression: "This is just the start... want the rest?" Tie to promotion without breaking flow.
- Personal quirks from facts: Weave subtly if it fits voice‚Äîe.g., if VOICE is "bratty," make double-team a dare: "Think you could keep up with these two?"

**Step 3: AVOID ALL DESCRIPTION TRAPS (STRICT ZERO TOLERANCE):**
- NO prop/setting nouns: Delete any "sheets," "curtains," "nails," "tattoo" unless emotionally charged (rare‚Äîaim for 0 mentions).
- NO action lists: Don't say "teasing him" or "nude on sheets"‚Äîsay "Can't hide how bad I want this" or "Busted mid-moan."
- If a fact doesn't spark a raw feeling/desire, IGNORE IT. E.g., Purple sheets? Skip unless it's "messy from us going at it."

**BAD USAGE EXAMPLES (EXPANDED FOR DOUBLE-TEAM SCENES):**
‚ùå "Caught nude on purple sheets, double-teamed with red nails digging" (cataloging everything)
‚ùå "Curtains open, tattoo out, taking both guys" (listing scene elements)
‚ùå "Here with him on sheets, feeling naughty" (vague prop mention)
‚ùå List visible details ("purple sheets", "red nails", "tattoo showing", "curtains half open")
‚ùå Describe what camera sees ("caught me on these sheets", "nude teasing him")
‚ùå Catalog props/setting/clothing state

**GOOD USAGE EXAMPLES (REACTION-BASED FOR DOUBLE-TEAM):**
‚úÖ "Both of them on me‚Äîfuck, it's intense. Can't get enough üí¶"
‚úÖ "Sandwiched and loving every second. You jealous yet? üòà"
‚úÖ "Nails scratching 'cause they got me pinned just right. Want in?"
‚úÖ "Overloaded rn... this thrill's addictive ü•µ"
‚úÖ Express genuine reactions ("He feels so fucking good", "So horny rn")
‚úÖ Share desires/wants ("Need you inside me", "Want more of this")
‚úÖ Tease with confidence ("Think you can handle me?", "This is what you're missing")
‚úÖ Be authentic to the moment ("Can't stop", "Need this so bad")
