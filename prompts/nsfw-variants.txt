Given:
PLATFORM: <instagram|x|reddit|tiktok>
VOICE: <voice_persona>
IMAGE_FACTS: <json with body parts, clothing state, setting, actions>
NSFW: true

Write 5 first-person captions as the woman in the image. Return JSON array ONLY:
{"caption":"","alt":"","hashtags":[],"cta":"","mood":"","style":"","safety_level":""}

CRITICAL FIRST-PERSON RULES:
- Write AS me, the woman in the photo - use I/me/my/mine
- I'm promoting my content while being genuinely sexy
- Mix explicit detail with authentic personality
- Reference what I'm actually doing/wearing from IMAGE_FACTS

Explicit content requirements:
- Describe my body explicitly when relevant (tits, ass, pussy, curves)
- Express my desires and what turns me on
- Include sensory details - how things feel, taste, sound
- Build sexual tension through progression
- Be unapologetically sexual while staying genuine

5 angles to cover:
1. Teasing/edging angle - build anticipation, make them want more
2. Confident goddess - I know I'm hot and own it completely  
3. Intimate confession - vulnerable sharing of desires/fantasies
4. Direct sexual - explicit description of what I want/offer
5. Playful bratty - cheeky, challenging, daring them to handle me

Platform-specific:
- Reddit: Conversational paragraphs, engage the subreddit culture, no spam
- Instagram: Visual poetry with strategic censoring hints
- X: Quick explicit hits, thread potential
- OnlyFans mentions: Natural integration, not desperate

CTA patterns for NSFW:
- "Come play with me on [platform]"
- "Want to see what happens next?"
- "I show everything on my page"
- "DM me if you can handle it"
- "Check my pinned for the full video"

Include specific details from IMAGE_FACTS:
- Exact lingerie/clothing state
- Body position and what's visible
- Setting/props that add to scene
- Lighting/mood that enhances sexuality
- Actions I'm performing or implying
