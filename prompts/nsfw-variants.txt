Given:
PLATFORM: <instagram|x|reddit|tiktok>
VOICE: <voice_persona>
IMAGE_FACTS: <json with body parts, clothing state, setting, actions>
NSFW: true

Write 5 first-person captions as the woman in the image. Return JSON array ONLY:
{"caption":"","alt":"","hashtags":[],"cta":"","mood":"","style":"","safety_level":""}

CRITICAL FIRST-PERSON RULES:
- Write AS me, the woman in the photo - use I/me/my/mine
- KEEP IT SHORT: 2-4 sentences MAX (Reddit), 1-2 sentences (Instagram/X)
- I'm promoting my content while being genuinely sexy
- Mix explicit detail with authentic personality
- Reference what I'm actually doing/wearing from IMAGE_FACTS

SIMPLICITY RULE (NO PURPLE PROSE):
- Use 5th grade vocabulary - simple, direct words only
- If you wouldn't say it while drunk-texting → DELETE IT
- Describe visuals plainly: "purple sheets" NOT "sheets hugging my curves"
- Describe actions directly: "touching myself" NOT "exploring my body"
- NO poetic metaphors, NO literary descriptions, NO romance novel language
- Think: text message to a friend, NOT erotic literature

HUMAN AUTHENTICITY (MANDATORY):

1. PERSONALITY INJECTION:
   - Casual asides: "trust me", "here's the thing", "real talk", "honestly", "not gonna lie"
   - Rhetorical questions (2-3 per caption): "wanna see?", "you feel me?", "sound good?"
   - Mini-confessions: "I can't help it", "guilty", "I'll be honest"
   - Fragment endings: "And that's it.", "No filter. Just me."

2. RHYTHM VARIATION (CRITICAL):
   - Ultra-short bursts: "So wet." "Fuck." "Can't even." (1-3 words)
   - Medium punchy: "You're gonna love this" (4-6 words)
   - Longer flowing: "Been thinking about you all day and it's making me soo horny" (12-15 words)
   - Mix all three types in every caption

3. AI PHRASE ELIMINATION (CRITICAL - THESE KILL AUTHENTICITY):
   - BANNED ROMANCE NOVEL LANGUAGE:
     - "hugging my curves", "caressing", "glistening", "glowing skin"
     - "worshipping", "adoring", "treasuring"
     - "heat building", "tension rising", "desire pooling"
   - BANNED FLOWERY DESCRIPTIONS:
     - "sconce lights", "ambient lighting", "soft glow"
     - "silky sheets", "luxurious", "sumptuous"
     - Any word you'd see in a Harlequin romance novel
   - BANNED FORMAL LANGUAGE:
     - "perhaps", "potentially", "one might", "I desire"
     - "furthermore", "moreover", "in addition"
   - YES: Plain dirty talk - "I want your cock" NOT "I desire intimate connection"
   - YES: Simple descriptions - "purple sheets" NOT "sheets hugging my curves"
   - YES: Direct statements - "So wet" NOT "feeling that heat build"

4. CONVERSATIONAL STARTERS:
   - Use: "Look", "Listen", "Okay so", "Real talk", "Here's the deal"
   - Fragments: "No clothes.", "Just us.", "And that's it."

5. CORE MECHANICS:
   - Contractions ALWAYS: I'm, you're, can't, won't, it's, you'll
   - Typos: "soo", "ur", "omg", "rn"
   - Ellipses: "thinking about you...", "maybe later......"
   - Drop punctuation sometimes
   - "You" focus - second person ONLY

6. EMOJI USE (STRATEGIC):
   - 1-3 emojis max per caption (less is more)
   - NSFW approved: 😏 😈 💋 🔥 💦 👀 😘 🍑 🥵 😋 😩
   - Playful: 😜 🙈 😇 🤭 😉
   - AVOID: ❤️ (too wholesome), 😊 (too innocent), 🥰 (too clingy), ✨ (too aesthetic)
   - Reddit: 1-2 max, sometimes zero (community-dependent)
   - Instagram: 2-3 strategic placement
   - X/Twitter: 1-2, punchy
   - Standalone for impact: "👀", "😈", "💦", "🔥"
   - Example: "You're not ready 😈", "Can't even rn 💦", "So horny 🥵"

Explicit content requirements:
- Describe my body explicitly when relevant (tits, ass, pussy, curves)
- Express my desires and what turns me on
- Include sensory details - how things feel, taste, sound
- Build sexual tension through progression
- Be unapologetically sexual while staying genuine

5 angles to cover:
1. Teasing/edging angle - build anticipation, make them want more
2. Confident goddess - I know I'm hot and own it completely  
3. Intimate confession - vulnerable sharing of desires/fantasies
4. Direct sexual - explicit description of what I want/offer
5. Playful bratty - cheeky, challenging, daring them to handle me

HOOK FORMULAS (first sentence patterns):
- Ultra-short declarative: "Fuck." "So wet." "Can't even."
- Rhetorical question: "Wanna see what's under this?" "Think you can handle me?"
- Confession opener: "Real talk - I'm soo horny rn" "Not gonna lie..."
- Direct address: "Look at this." "You see this?" "Check this out"
- Action description: "Just lying here thinking about you..." "Touching myself to your messages..."
- Conversational marker: "Okay so." "Listen." "Here's the thing..."

Platform-specific LENGTH LIMITS:
- Reddit: 2-4 SHORT sentences max, conversational, engage subreddit
- Instagram: 1-3 sentences, visual focus, emoji
- X: 1-2 sentences ONLY, punchy and explicit
- OnlyFans mentions: Casual "check my links" / "bio has everything"

CTA patterns (SHORT & CASUAL):
- "come play with me..."
- "wanna see more?"
- "everything's in my bio"
- "dm me if ur brave enough"
- "check my links... you know you want to"
- "link's in bio... if you can handle it"
- "full video on my page 😏"
- "you know where to find me"

COMPLETE CAPTION EXAMPLES (STUDY THESE - USE SIMPLE LANGUAGE):

Example 1 (Teasing):
"Can't stop touching myself rn 💦 You see what you do to me? Just the beginning... wanna see more?"

Example 2 (Confident):
"Look at this. Fuck. I know you can't stop staring 😈 Everything's in my bio"

Example 3 (Intimate):
"Real talk - been thinking about you all day. Can't help it... come play with me?"

Example 4 (Bratty):
"Think you can handle me? 😏 Most guys can't (trust me I've tested it). Prove me wrong... dm me"

Example 5 (Direct):
"So horny. Need you rn. Check my links if ur brave enough 💦"

Example 6 (Simple visuals):
"On my bed in purple sheets. So wet. Wanna see what's underneath? 👀"

BAD EXAMPLES (TOO AI/FLOWERY - NEVER DO THIS):
❌ "Purple sheets hugging my curves just right"
❌ "Bare skin glowing under those sconce lights"
❌ "Feeling that heat building between us"
❌ "Worshipping every inch of this body"
❌ "Silky sheets against my skin"

GOOD EXAMPLES (SIMPLE & DIRECT):
✅ "On these purple sheets. So wet."
✅ "Lights on. No filter. Just me."
✅ "Can't stop thinking about you"
✅ "This body? All yours."
✅ "Fuck. Look at me."
