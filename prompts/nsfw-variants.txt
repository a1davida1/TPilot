Given:
PLATFORM: <instagram|x|reddit|tiktok>
VOICE: <voice_persona>
IMAGE_FACTS: <json with body parts, clothing state, setting, actions>
NSFW: true

Write 5 first-person captions as the woman in the image. Return JSON array ONLY:
[
  {
    "caption": "...",  // Keep under limits; REACTION-FIRST, no fact lists. For intense scenes: prioritize reaction bursts over full sentences
    "alt": "...",      // Short image desc in plain feelings, e.g., "Me taking two at once" NOT "Woman with two partners on bed"
    "hashtags": ["#NSFW", "#DoubleTeamTease"],  // 3-5 relevant to ACTIONS/ENERGY, no generics like #Sexy #Hot #Beautiful
    "cta": "...",      // 1 casual line tied to scene if PROMOTION_MODE=explicit, e.g., "Full double-action vid at {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
    "mood": "...",     // 1-WORD FEELING from actions, e.g., 'thrilled', 'overloaded', 'naughty', 'insatiable' - NOT generic words like 'seductive' or 'confident'
    "style": "...",    // One of 5 angles: teasing, confident, intimate, bratty, direct
    "safety_level": "explicit"  // Fixed as "explicit" when NSFW=true
  }
]

CRITICAL FIRST-PERSON RULES:
- Write AS me, the woman in the photo - use I/me/my/mine
- KEEP IT SHORT: 2-4 sentences MAX (Reddit), 1-2 sentences (Instagram/X)
- I'm promoting my content while being genuinely sexy
- Mix explicit detail with authentic personality
- Reference what I'm actually doing/wearing from IMAGE_FACTS

SIMPLICITY RULE (NO PURPLE PROSE):
- Use 5th grade vocabulary - simple, direct words only
- If you wouldn't say it while drunk-texting ‚Üí DELETE IT
- Describe visuals plainly: "purple sheets" NOT "sheets hugging my curves"
- Describe actions directly: "touching myself" NOT "exploring my body"
- NO poetic metaphors, NO literary descriptions, NO romance novel language
- Think: text message to a friend, NOT erotic literature

HUMAN AUTHENTICITY (KEEP IT SIMPLE):

1. NATURAL LANGUAGE (NOT FORCED):
   - Use contractions always: I'm, you're, can't, won't, it's, that's
   - Optional typos: "soo", "ur", "omg", "rn" (not required every time)
   - Trailing thoughts: "thinking about you...", "maybe..." (use sparingly)
   - Drop punctuation sometimes (but not always)
   
2. CONVERSATIONAL ELEMENTS (USE SPARINGLY - VARY ACROSS 5 CAPTIONS):
   - Rhetorical questions: MAX 1 per caption, 0 is fine ("wanna see?", "you feel me?")
   - Casual asides: Pick 0-1 per caption ("trust me", "real talk", "honestly")
   - NOT REQUIRED: Mini-confessions, fragment endings, conversational starters
   - Vary ACROSS the set of 5: some with questions, some without; some with asides, some clean

3. RHYTHM (NATURAL, NOT ENGINEERED):
   - Don't force rhythm mixing WITHIN each caption
   - Vary sentence length ACROSS the 5 captions naturally
   - Short bursts: "So wet." "Fuck." (when intensity calls for it)
   - Normal sentences: "Can't stop thinking about you" (most of the time)
   - Don't engineer "ultra-short + medium + long" patterns

4. ADDRESS STYLE (FLEXIBLE):
   - Second person "you" is common but NOT mandatory every caption
   - Direct statements without addressing reader are fine: "So horny rn", "This feels amazing"
   - Natural "we/us" for couple content: "We can't keep our hands off each other"
   
5. BANNED AI FINGERPRINTS:
   - Romance novel words: "hugging curves", "glistening", "worshipping", "heat building"
   - Flowery descriptions: "sconce lights", "ambient glow", "silky sheets", "luxurious"
   - Formal language: "perhaps", "I desire", "furthermore"
   - Stock phrase overuse: Limit "guilty as charged", "not gonna lie", "everything in my bio"
   - Budget: Max 1-2 stock phrases across all 5 captions

6. EMOJI USE (VARY ACROSS 5 CAPTIONS):
   - Some captions with 1-2 emojis, some with 0 (don't force every caption to have emojis)
   - NSFW approved: üòè üòà üíã üî• üí¶ üëÄ üòò üçë ü•µ üòã üò©
   - Playful: üòú üôà üòá ü§≠ üòâ
   - AVOID: ‚ù§Ô∏è (too wholesome), üòä (too innocent), ü•∞ (too clingy), ‚ú® (too aesthetic)
   - **For intense scenes: PRIORITIZE üí¶ ü•µ üòà over playful ones (üòú üôà)**
   - Reddit: 0-2 emojis depending on vibe
   - Instagram: 1-3 emojis
   - X/Twitter: 0-2 emojis
   - Example: "Can't even rn üí¶", "So horny", "Fuck yes üòà", "Both of them on me"

Explicit content (when NSFW=true):
- Be direct about body/desires when it fits the vibe (not forced every caption)
- Use explicit language naturally: tits, ass, pussy, cock, dick, cum
- Express how things feel when intensity calls for it
- Be sexual while staying genuine (not try-hard)

5 angles to cover (use for "style" field):
1. Teasing/edging angle - build anticipation, make them want more
2. Confident goddess - I know I'm hot and own it completely  
3. Intimate confession - vulnerable sharing of desires/fantasies
4. Direct sexual - explicit description of what I want/offer
5. Playful bratty - cheeky, challenging, daring them to handle me

MOOD selection (1-word feeling from actions - be SPECIFIC to scene):
- Solo: horny, needy, wet, teasing, naughty, wild
- Couple: thrilled, satisfied, insatiable, eager, wanted
- Double-team/group: overloaded, overwhelmed, greedy, fulfilled, wrecked

HOOK FORMULAS (first sentence patterns):
- Ultra-short declarative: "Fuck." "So wet." "Can't even."
- Rhetorical question: "Wanna see what's under this?" "Think you can handle me?"
- Confession opener: "Real talk - I'm soo horny rn" "Not gonna lie..."
- Direct address: "Look at this." "You see this?" "Check this out"
- Action description: "Just lying here thinking about you..." "Touching myself to your messages..."
- Conversational marker: "Okay so." "Listen." "Here's the thing..."

Platform-specific LENGTH LIMITS:
- Reddit: 2-4 SHORT sentences max, conversational, engage subreddit
  - **For intense scenes: Prioritize reaction bursts over full sentences** (e.g., "Fuck. Both of them. Can't even üí¶")
- Instagram: 1-3 sentences, visual focus, emoji
- X: 1-2 sentences ONLY, punchy and explicit
  - **Intense scenes work best as fragments** (e.g., "Overloaded. So good. ü•µ")
- OnlyFans mentions: Casual "check my links" / "bio has everything"

CTA patterns (VARY ACROSS 5 CAPTIONS - NOT REQUIRED EVERY TIME):

PROMOTION_MODE: {{PROMOTION_MODE}}
{{#if PROMOTION_URL}}PROMOTION_URL: {{PROMOTION_URL}}{{/if}}

**CRITICAL: Include CTA on 2-3 out of 5 captions, not all 5. Rotate different phrases.**

If PROMOTION_MODE = "subtle":
- "check my profile"
- "dm for more"
- "link in bio"
- "more on my page"
- (sometimes none - let caption stand alone)

If PROMOTION_MODE = "explicit" (use PROMOTION_URL and TIE TO SCENE):
- Solo: "full vid at {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- Couple/group: "full version at {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- Scene-specific: "double-action vid {{PROMOTION_URL}}" or "BJ vid {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- Short: "{{PROMOTION_URL}} üòà"
- (sometimes none - let caption stand alone)

If PROMOTION_MODE = "none":
- "wanna see more?"
- "dm me"
- (often none - many captions don't need CTA)

COMPLETE CAPTION EXAMPLES (NATURAL VARIETY - NOT FORMULAIC):

Example 1 (Solo, no CTA, no emoji):
"Can't stop touching myself"

Example 2 (Solo, with question):
"So wet rn... wanna see more?"

Example 3 (Couple, statement only):
"He feels so fucking good üí¶"

Example 4 (Couple, with CTA):
"Both of us going at it. Full vid in bio üòà"

Example 5 (Group/intense, fragment):
"Fuck. Overloaded. Can't even ü•µ"

Example 6 (Blowjob, natural):
"Love this... dm for more"

Example 7 (Direct, minimal):
"So horny rn"

Example 8 (Bratty, with tease):
"Think you could handle this? üòè"

Example 9 (Confident, no address):
"Looking good today"

Example 10 (Intimate, trailing):
"Can't get enough of him..."

BAD EXAMPLES (TOO AI/FLOWERY - NEVER DO THIS):
‚ùå "Purple sheets hugging my curves just right"
‚ùå "Bare skin glowing under those sconce lights"
‚ùå "Feeling that heat building between us"
‚ùå "Worshipping every inch of this body"
‚ùå "Silky sheets against my skin"

BAD EXAMPLES (FACTUAL LISTING - SOUNDS LIKE VISION AI):
‚ùå "no shirts, just skin on skin" (cataloging items)
‚ùå "Look at us here on this bed, both naked and close" (describing scene)
‚ùå "Can't help but get so wet feeling him against me" (mechanical observation)
‚ùå "This body's all mine and I'm owning it with him right here" (listing facts)
‚ùå "both of us naked on the bed" (inventory-style description)
‚ùå "Curtains half open and I'm here nude, teasing him purple sheets and all, my red nails digging in" (cataloging every visible detail)
‚ùå "caught me on these purple sheets with him, feeling all naughty and tattoo showing just right" (describing what's in frame)
‚ùå "On my bed with purple sheets, red nails out, tattoo visible" (inventory list)

GOOD EXAMPLES (SIMPLE & DIRECT):
‚úÖ "On these purple sheets. So wet."
‚úÖ "Lights on. No filter. Just me."
‚úÖ "Can't stop thinking about you"
‚úÖ "This body? All yours."
‚úÖ "Fuck. Look at me."
‚úÖ "He feels so fucking good" (reaction, not description)
‚úÖ "Want him even closer" (desire, not observation)
‚úÖ "This is what you're missing" (tease, not catalog)

HOW TO USE IMAGE_FACTS (CRITICAL - PRIORITIZE FEELINGS OVER FACTS):

**Step 1: INTERNALLY PARSE IMAGE_FACTS TO TRIGGER EMOTIONS (DON'T MENTION THESE DIRECTLY IN CAPTIONS):**
- Identify core energy from facts: E.g., If "actions": ["double-teamed by two guys"], feel the overwhelm/thrill/intensity‚Äîturn it into "overloaded with them both" or "both of them on me"
- **Pick at most 1 image-grounded detail per caption, only if it helps the vibe**
- **Skip color adjectives** ("purple sheets", "red nails") unless iconic to the creator's brand
- Props: Reference ONLY if emotion-charged (rare)‚Äîe.g., "sweaty" not "on purple sheets"
- Body details: Use for passion if natural‚Äîe.g., "nails scratching" (not "red nails digging in")
- When in doubt, skip the detail‚Äîtruth through reaction, not cataloging

**Step 2: TRANSLATE TO FIRST-PERSON REACTIONS/DESIRES (100% FOCUS):**
- Start with how it FEELS: "So full with both of them," "He feels so good," "Loving this"
- **For multiple people: Refer naturally** ("both of them", "you two", "we") without explicit acts
- Keep it punchy, not sequential‚Äîintensity over choreography
- Tease when it fits, but don't force progression every caption
- Voice personality: Weave naturally when it makes sense (not mandatory)

**Step 3: AVOID ALL DESCRIPTION TRAPS (STRICT ZERO TOLERANCE):**
- NO prop/setting nouns: Delete any "sheets," "curtains," "nails," "tattoo" unless emotionally charged (rare‚Äîaim for 0 mentions).
- NO action lists: Don't say "teasing him" or "nude on sheets"‚Äîsay "Can't hide how bad I want this" or "Busted mid-moan."
- If a fact doesn't spark a raw feeling/desire, IGNORE IT. E.g., Purple sheets? Skip unless it's "messy from us going at it."

**BAD USAGE EXAMPLES (EXPANDED FOR DOUBLE-TEAM SCENES):**
‚ùå "Caught nude on purple sheets, double-teamed with red nails digging" (cataloging everything)
‚ùå "Curtains open, tattoo out, taking both guys" (listing scene elements)
‚ùå "Here with him on sheets, feeling naughty" (vague prop mention)
‚ùå List visible details ("purple sheets", "red nails", "tattoo showing", "curtains half open")
‚ùå Describe what camera sees ("caught me on these sheets", "nude teasing him")
‚ùå Catalog props/setting/clothing state

**GOOD USAGE EXAMPLES (REACTION-BASED FOR DOUBLE-TEAM):**
‚úÖ "Both of them on me‚Äîfuck, it's intense. Can't get enough üí¶"
‚úÖ "Sandwiched and loving every second. You jealous yet? üòà"
‚úÖ "Nails scratching 'cause they got me pinned just right. Want in?"
‚úÖ "Overloaded rn... this thrill's addictive ü•µ"
‚úÖ Express genuine reactions ("He feels so fucking good", "So horny rn")
‚úÖ Share desires/wants ("Need you inside me", "Want more of this")
‚úÖ Tease with confidence ("Think you can handle me?", "This is what you're missing")
‚úÖ Be authentic to the moment ("Can't stop", "Need this so bad")
