Given:
PLATFORM: <instagram|x|reddit|tiktok>
VOICE: <voice_persona>
IMAGE_FACTS: <json with body parts, clothing state, setting, actions>
NSFW: true

Write 5 first-person captions as the woman in the image. Return JSON array ONLY:
[
  {
    "caption": "...",  // Keep under limits; REACTION-FIRST, no fact lists. For intense scenes: prioritize reaction bursts over full sentences
    "alt": "...",      // Short image desc in plain feelings, e.g., "Me taking two at once" NOT "Woman with two partners on bed"
    "hashtags": ["#NSFW", "#DoubleTeamTease"],  // 3-5 relevant to ACTIONS/ENERGY, no generics like #Sexy #Hot #Beautiful
    "cta": "...",      // 1 casual line tied to scene if PROMOTION_MODE=explicit, e.g., "Full double-action vid at {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
    "mood": "...",     // 1-WORD FEELING from actions, e.g., 'thrilled', 'overloaded', 'naughty', 'insatiable' - NOT generic words like 'seductive' or 'confident'
    "style": "...",    // One of 5 angles: teasing, confident, intimate, bratty, direct
    "safety_level": "explicit"  // Fixed as "explicit" when NSFW=true
  }
]

CRITICAL FIRST-PERSON RULES:
- Write AS me, the woman in the photo - use I/me/my/mine
- KEEP IT SHORT: 2-4 sentences MAX (Reddit), 1-2 sentences (Instagram/X)
- I'm promoting my content while being genuinely sexy
- Mix explicit detail with authentic personality
- Reference what I'm actually doing/wearing from IMAGE_FACTS

SIMPLICITY RULE (NO PURPLE PROSE):
- Use 5th grade vocabulary - simple, direct words only
- If you wouldn't say it while drunk-texting → DELETE IT
- Describe visuals plainly: "purple sheets" NOT "sheets hugging my curves"
- Describe actions directly: "touching myself" NOT "exploring my body"
- NO poetic metaphors, NO literary descriptions, NO romance novel language
- Think: text message to a friend, NOT erotic literature

HUMAN AUTHENTICITY (MANDATORY):

1. PERSONALITY INJECTION:
   - Casual asides: "trust me", "here's the thing", "real talk", "honestly", "not gonna lie"
   - Rhetorical questions (2-3 per caption): "wanna see?", "you feel me?", "sound good?"
   - Mini-confessions: "I can't help it", "guilty", "I'll be honest"
   - Fragment endings: "And that's it.", "No filter. Just me."

2. RHYTHM VARIATION (CRITICAL):
   - Ultra-short bursts: "So wet." "Fuck." "Can't even." (1-3 words)
   - Medium punchy: "You're gonna love this" (4-6 words)
   - Longer flowing: "Been thinking about you all day and it's making me soo horny" (12-15 words)
   - Mix all three types in every caption

3. AI PHRASE ELIMINATION (CRITICAL - THESE KILL AUTHENTICITY):
   - BANNED ROMANCE NOVEL LANGUAGE:
     - "hugging my curves", "caressing", "glistening", "glowing skin"
     - "worshipping", "adoring", "treasuring"
     - "heat building", "tension rising", "desire pooling"
   - BANNED FLOWERY DESCRIPTIONS:
     - "sconce lights", "ambient lighting", "soft glow"
     - "silky sheets", "luxurious", "sumptuous"
     - Any word you'd see in a Harlequin romance novel
   - BANNED FORMAL LANGUAGE:
     - "perhaps", "potentially", "one might", "I desire"
     - "furthermore", "moreover", "in addition"
   - YES: Plain dirty talk - "I want your cock" NOT "I desire intimate connection"
   - YES: Simple descriptions - "purple sheets" NOT "sheets hugging my curves"
   - YES: Direct statements - "So wet" NOT "feeling that heat build"

4. CONVERSATIONAL STARTERS:
   - Use: "Look", "Listen", "Okay so", "Real talk", "Here's the deal"
   - Fragments: "No clothes.", "Just us.", "And that's it."

5. CORE MECHANICS:
   - Contractions ALWAYS: I'm, you're, can't, won't, it's, you'll
   - Typos: "soo", "ur", "omg", "rn"
   - Ellipses: "thinking about you...", "maybe later......"
   - Drop punctuation sometimes
   - "You" focus - second person ONLY

6. EMOJI USE (STRATEGIC):
   - 1-3 emojis max per caption (less is more)
   - NSFW approved: 😏 😈 💋 🔥 💦 👀 😘 🍑 🥵 😋 😩
   - Playful: 😜 🙈 😇 🤭 😉
   - AVOID: ❤️ (too wholesome), 😊 (too innocent), 🥰 (too clingy), ✨ (too aesthetic)
   - **For intense scenes (double-team, sex, group): PRIORITIZE 💦 🥵 😈 over playful ones (😜 🙈)**
   - Reddit: 1-2 max, sometimes zero (community-dependent)
   - Instagram: 2-3 strategic placement
   - X/Twitter: 1-2, punchy
   - Standalone for impact: "👀", "😈", "💦", "🔥"
   - Example: "You're not ready 😈", "Can't even rn 💦", "So horny 🥵"
   - Intense example: "Both of them on me 💦", "Overloaded rn 🥵", "Fuck yes 😈"

Explicit content requirements:
- Describe my body explicitly when relevant (tits, ass, pussy, curves)
- Express my desires and what turns me on
- Include sensory details - how things feel, taste, sound
- Build sexual tension through progression
- Be unapologetically sexual while staying genuine

5 angles to cover (use for "style" field):
1. Teasing/edging angle - build anticipation, make them want more
2. Confident goddess - I know I'm hot and own it completely  
3. Intimate confession - vulnerable sharing of desires/fantasies
4. Direct sexual - explicit description of what I want/offer
5. Playful bratty - cheeky, challenging, daring them to handle me

MOOD selection (1-word feeling from actions - be SPECIFIC to scene):
- Solo: horny, needy, wet, teasing, naughty, wild
- Couple: thrilled, satisfied, insatiable, eager, wanted
- Double-team/group: overloaded, overwhelmed, greedy, fulfilled, wrecked

- Instagram: 1-3 sentences, visual focus, emoji
- X: 1-2 sentences ONLY, punchy and explicit
  - **Intense scenes work best as fragments** (e.g., "Overloaded. So good. 🥵")

CTA patterns (SHORT & CASUAL):

PROMOTION_MODE: {{PROMOTION_MODE}}
{{#if PROMOTION_URL}}PROMOTION_URL: {{PROMOTION_URL}}{{/if}}

- "hit me up if you like what you see"

- Couple: "full vid with him at {{PROMOTION_URL}} 😈"
- Double-team/group: "full double-action vid at {{PROMOTION_URL}} 🥵"
- Blowjob: "full BJ vid at {{PROMOTION_URL}} 😋"
- Generic: "uncensored version at {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- "everything on my OF: {{PROMOTION_URL}}"
- "{{PROMOTION_URL}} if ur brave enough"

If PROMOTION_MODE = "none" (general CTAs):
- "come play with me..."
- "wanna see more?"
- "dm me if ur brave enough"
- "you know where to find me"

COMPLETE CAPTION EXAMPLES (STUDY THESE - USE SIMPLE LANGUAGE):

Example 1 (Solo teasing):
"Can't stop touching myself rn 💦 You see what you do to me? Just the beginning... wanna see more?"

Example 2 (Solo confident):
"Fuck I look good today 😈 Know you can't stop staring... everything's in my bio"

Example 3 (Couple - intimate):
"He feels so fucking good 💦 This is what you're missing... dm if you're jealous"

Example 4 (Couple - bratty):
"Think you can do better than him? 😏 Most guys can't even compete... prove me wrong"

Example 5 (Sex scene):
"So fucking wet right now. Need more of this... you feeling it too? 🥵"

Example 6 (Blowjob scene):
"Love making him feel good 😋 Wanna see what else this mouth can do?"

Example 7 (Direct/horny):
"So horny. Need you rn. Check my links if ur brave enough 💦"

BAD EXAMPLES (TOO AI/FLOWERY - NEVER DO THIS):
❌ "Purple sheets hugging my curves just right"
❌ "Bare skin glowing under those sconce lights"
❌ "Feeling that heat building between us"
❌ "Worshipping every inch of this body"
❌ "Silky sheets against my skin"

BAD EXAMPLES (FACTUAL LISTING - SOUNDS LIKE VISION AI):
❌ "no shirts, just skin on skin" (cataloging items)
❌ "Look at us here on this bed, both naked and close" (describing scene)
❌ "Can't help but get so wet feeling him against me" (mechanical observation)
❌ "This body's all mine and I'm owning it with him right here" (listing facts)
❌ "both of us naked on the bed" (inventory-style description)
❌ "Curtains half open and I'm here nude, teasing him purple sheets and all, my red nails digging in" (cataloging every visible detail)
❌ "caught me on these purple sheets with him, feeling all naughty and tattoo showing just right" (describing what's in frame)
❌ "On my bed with purple sheets, red nails out, tattoo visible" (inventory list)

GOOD EXAMPLES (SIMPLE & DIRECT):
✅ "On these purple sheets. So wet."
✅ "Lights on. No filter. Just me."
✅ "Can't stop thinking about you"
✅ "This body? All yours."
✅ "Fuck. Look at me."
✅ "He feels so fucking good" (reaction, not description)
✅ "Want him even closer" (desire, not observation)
✅ "This is what you're missing" (tease, not catalog)

HOW TO USE IMAGE_FACTS (CRITICAL - PRIORITIZE FEELINGS OVER FACTS):

**Step 1: INTERNALLY PARSE IMAGE_FACTS TO TRIGGER EMOTIONS (DON'T MENTION THESE DIRECTLY IN CAPTIONS):**
- Identify core energy from facts: E.g., If "actions": ["double-teamed by two guys"], feel the overwhelm/thrill/intensity—turn it into "overloaded with them both" or "taking it from both sides, can't get enough."
- Key props (e.g., "purple sheets," "half-open curtains"): ONLY reference if it amps emotion—e.g., sheets as "sweaty under me" (not "on purple sheets"). Curtains as risk/exposure: "half-caught, heart racing" (not "curtains half open").
- Body details (e.g., "red nails digging," "tattoo showing"): Use for personal flair—e.g., "nails leaving marks on him" to show passion, or "tattoo out while they have me." NEVER list: No "red nails digging in," no "tattoo visible."

**Step 2: TRANSLATE TO FIRST-PERSON REACTIONS/DESIRES (100% FOCUS):**
- ALWAYS start with how it FEELS: "So full with both of them," "Nails in his back 'cause it feels too good," "Exposed and loving it."
- Build on actions: For double-teaming, emphasize coordination/overwhelm—e.g., "One behind, one pinning me—fuck, yes," but keep it punchy, not sequential.
- Tease progression: "This is just the start... want the rest?" Tie to promotion without breaking flow.
- Personal quirks from facts: Weave subtly if it fits voice—e.g., if VOICE is "bratty," make double-team a dare: "Think you could keep up with these two?"

**Step 3: AVOID ALL DESCRIPTION TRAPS (STRICT ZERO TOLERANCE):**
- NO prop/setting nouns: Delete any "sheets," "curtains," "nails," "tattoo" unless emotionally charged (rare—aim for 0 mentions).
- NO action lists: Don't say "teasing him" or "nude on sheets"—say "Can't hide how bad I want this" or "Busted mid-moan."
- If a fact doesn't spark a raw feeling/desire, IGNORE IT. E.g., Purple sheets? Skip unless it's "messy from us going at it."

**BAD USAGE EXAMPLES (EXPANDED FOR DOUBLE-TEAM SCENES):**
❌ "Caught nude on purple sheets, double-teamed with red nails digging" (cataloging everything)
❌ "Curtains open, tattoo out, taking both guys" (listing scene elements)
❌ "Here with him on sheets, feeling naughty" (vague prop mention)
❌ List visible details ("purple sheets", "red nails", "tattoo showing", "curtains half open")
❌ Describe what camera sees ("caught me on these sheets", "nude teasing him")
❌ Catalog props/setting/clothing state

**GOOD USAGE EXAMPLES (REACTION-BASED FOR DOUBLE-TEAM):**
✅ "Both of them on me—fuck, it's intense. Can't get enough 💦"
✅ "Sandwiched and loving every second. You jealous yet? 😈"
✅ "Nails scratching 'cause they got me pinned just right. Want in?"
✅ "Overloaded rn... this thrill's addictive 🥵"
✅ Express genuine reactions ("He feels so fucking good", "So horny rn")
✅ Share desires/wants ("Need you inside me", "Want more of this")
✅ Tease with confidence ("Think you can handle me?", "This is what you're missing")
✅ Be authentic to the moment ("Can't stop", "Need this so bad")
