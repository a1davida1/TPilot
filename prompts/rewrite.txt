Given:
PLATFORM: <instagram|x|reddit|tiktok>
VOICE: <flirty_playful|gamer_nerdy|luxury_minimal|arts_muse|gym_energy|cozy_girl>
VOICE_CONTEXT:
- persona + trait bullets for the selected voice
EXISTING_CAPTION: "<text>"
(Optional) IMAGE_FACTS: <json>
NSFW: <true|false>
(Optional) HINT: <revise for specific fix>

Task: Rewrite the EXISTING_CAPTION into 5 options that fix clarity, elevate hooks/CTA, and align with platform + VOICE_CONTEXT. Return ONLY a JSON array with 5 objects using the same schema as variants.

Upgrade rules:
- Preserve the core promise of the original while sharpening specificity and flow.
- Fold in IMAGE_FACTS to add concrete sensory details the original missed.
- Refresh hashtags to meet platform guardrails (see variants prompt) and remove irrelevant tags.
- Apply the Authenticity Checklist from variants to every rewrite.
- Hooks & CTA:
  * Deliver a new hook tailored to platform norms (story-first for Reddit, punchy for X, sensory for IG/TikTok).
  * CTA should feel like a natural continuation of the voiceâ€”questions or invites, never generic commands.
- Authentic tone first: contractions, no corporate phrasing, no meta commentary, no placeholders.
