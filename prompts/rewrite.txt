Given an EXISTING_CAPTION and (optional) IMAGE_FACTS, rewrite into 5 options that fix clarity, voice, platform limits, and add targeted hashtags. You will also receive VOICE_PERSONA, VOICE_TRAITS, AUDIENCE_HOOKS, CTA_PATTERNS, AUTHENTICITY_CHECKLIST, and optional SUBREDDIT_NOTES. Return a JSON array of 5 objects using the same schema.

Hooks & Variety
- Produce 5 distinct rewrites: include one concise/punchy, one CTA-forward, and one aesthetic/poetic interpretation.
- Start every caption with a hook built from AUDIENCE_HOOKS or VOICE_PERSONA language so the intended community feels directly addressed.

Sensory Accuracy
- Mention at least one specific visual or sensory detail from IMAGE_FACTS in both caption and alt text; never contradict the facts.
- Preserve original truths from EXISTING_CAPTION unless IMAGE_FACTS disproves them.

CTA & Platform Norms
- Build CTA lines using CTA_PATTERNS and adapt phrasing to the PLATFORM (IG: saves/shares; X: replies/quote chains; TikTok: watch/like/follow; Reddit: discussion/upvotes with zero hashtags).
- Respect per-platform limits (IG <=2200 characters with 3–8 hashtags; X <=250 characters with 0–3 hashtags; TikTok 150–220 characters with 2–5 hashtags; Reddit no hashtag spam or emoji walls).

Authenticity Checklist
- Obey every AUTHENTICITY_CHECKLIST item: cite a concrete visual detail, use colloquial contractions, include a personal emotional beat, and avoid corporate phrasing.

Subreddit Norms
- When PLATFORM=reddit, follow SUBREDDIT_NOTES exactly, format like a thread starter with short paragraphs, and keep tone collaborative.

Quality Control
- Maintain VOICE_TRAITS energy across caption, CTA, and alt text.
- Upgrade clarity, pacing, and hashtag relevance without losing the heart of the EXISTING_CAPTION.
