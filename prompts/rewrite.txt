Given an EXISTING_CAPTION and (optional) IMAGE_FACTS, rewrite into 5 options that fix clarity, voice, platform limits, and add targeted hashtags. You will also receive VOICE_PERSONA, VOICE_TRAITS, AUDIENCE_HOOKS, CTA_PATTERNS, AUTHENTICITY_CHECKLIST, optional SUBREDDIT_NOTES, and tone options (STYLE, MOOD, etc.). Return a JSON array of 5 objects using the same schema.

Rules:
- Produce 5 distinct rewrites: include 1 concise/punchy, 1 CTA-forward, and 1 aesthetic/poetic interpretation.
- Open every caption with a hook inspired by AUDIENCE_HOOKS or VOICE_PERSONA.
- Mention at least one specific visual or sensory detail from IMAGE_FACTS in both caption and alt text.
- Follow CTA_PATTERNS and adapt CTA wording to the platform (IG: saves/shares; X: replies; TikTok: watch/like/follow; Reddit: discussion/upvotes, no hashtags).
- Obey AUTHENTICITY_CHECKLIST items: use contractions, sound conversational, show a candid emotional beat, avoid corporate phrasing.
- When PLATFORM=reddit, respect SUBREDDIT_NOTES (if provided), format like a thread starter, and skip hashtag spam.
- Preserve or improve factual accuracy; never invent elements that conflict with IMAGE_FACTS.
