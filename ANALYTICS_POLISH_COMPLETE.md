#### 1. GET /api/analytics/user-subreddits
**Purpose**: Fetch subreddits user has posted to (not hardcoded)

**Query Params**:
- `userId` (optional, defaults to authenticated user)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 12,
  "subreddits": ["gonewild", "RealGirls", "PetiteGoneWild", ...]
}
```

**Features**:
- Queries distinct subreddits from `postMetrics` table
- Ordered by most recent activity
- Limit 50 subreddits
- Fallback to popular subs if empty

---

#### 2. GET /api/analytics/historical-performance
**Purpose**: Get performance trends over time for graphing

**Query Params**:
- `subreddit` (required)
- `userId` (optional, defaults to authenticated user)
- `days` (optional, default 30, max 90)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "subreddit": "gonewild",
  "days": 30,
  "dataPoints": 28,
  "data": [
    {
      "date": "2025-10-01",
      "avgScore": 247,
      "totalPosts": 3
    },
    // ... more daily data
  ]
}
```

**Features**:
- Daily aggregated metrics
- Configurable time range
- Optimized query with grouping
- Ready for time-series charting

---

### Infrastructure Files

#### server/lib/subreddit-discovery.ts (NEW)
**Purpose**: Framework for auto-discovering subreddits during onboarding

**Key Functions**:
- `ensureSubredditExists()` - Add sub to database if new
- `fetchSubredditInfo()` - Get sub data from Reddit API
- `enrichDiscoveredSubreddits()` - Weekly cron to aggregate metrics
- `calculateSubredditMetrics()` - Aggregate user data

**Status**: Ready but not yet integrated into onboarding flow  
**Future Work**: Connect to Reddit OAuth callback (1-2 hour task)

---

## Frontend Enhancements ✅

### File: client/src/pages/performance-analytics.tsx
**Total Changes**: ~200 lines added/modified

### 1. Empty State ✅
**Problem**: Users with no posts saw "loading" forever  
**Solution**: Beautiful empty state with feature preview

**Features**:
- Welcoming message
- 3 preview cards showing what analytics offers
- CTA button to create first post
- Professional design

**User Impact**: New users understand the value proposition

---

### 2. Dynamic Subreddit Loading ✅
**Problem**: Hardcoded 7 subreddits, useless for many users  
**Solution**: Load from user's actual post history

**Implementation**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  loadUserSubreddits(); // Fetches from API
}, [user?.id]);

// Falls back to popular subs if user has no posts
```

**Features**:
- Loads user's subreddits on mount
- Auto-selects most recent
- Fallback to popular subs
- Updates when user posts to new subs

**User Impact**: Actually useful for their content

---

### 3. Loading Skeletons ✅
**Problem**: Jarring white screen while loading  
**Solution**: Smooth skeleton placeholders using shadcn Skeleton component

**Features**:
- Skeleton for header
- 4 metric card skeletons
- Chart area skeleton
- Smooth transitions
- Professional feel

**User Impact**: Perceived performance improvement

---

### 4. Error States ✅
**Problem**: Silent failures, users confused  
**Solution**: Clear error UI with retry button

**Features**:
- AlertCircle icon
- Error message display
- Retry button
- Clean, centered layout

**User Impact**: Users can diagnose and fix issues

---

### 5. Historical Performance Graph ✅
**Problem**: No way to see improvement over time  
**Solution**: LineChart showing 30-day trend

**Features**:
- Recharts LineChart component
- Shows avgScore and totalPosts
- Date formatting on X-axis
- Tooltip with details
- Purple/blue styling
- Only shows if data exists

**Location**: Overview tab, above comparison charts

**User Impact**: Visual proof of growth

---

### 6. Timezone Support ✅
**Problem**: Peak hours shown in UTC, users confused  
**Solution**: Auto-convert to user's local timezone

**Features**:
- Auto-detects user timezone: `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
- Converts UTC hours to local
- Shows both local and UTC in tooltips
- Updates all time displays
- Timezone name in header

**Example**:
```
Before: "Peak hours: 20:00, 21:00, 22:00"
After: "Peak hours: 15:00, 16:00, 17:00 local (20:00, 21:00, 22:00 UTC)"
Timezone: America/New_York
```

**User Impact**: Times actually make sense to them

---

### 7. PDF Export ✅
**Problem**: Users want to share results with team/VA  
**Solution**: Export button generating downloadable report

**Features**:
- Button in header with Download icon
- Generates text-based report (TXT format for now)
- Includes all key metrics
- Peak hours in local time
- All recommendations
- Timestamped filename

**Future Enhancement**: Use `jspdf` library for actual PDF (15 min)

**User Impact**: Easy sharing
