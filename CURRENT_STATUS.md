## üö® Critical Issues Found Today

### 1. Missing Environment Variables (42 missing!)
**Impact**: Multiple features broken or degraded

**Missing Critical Vars**:
```bash
# AI Generation (caption generation will fail!)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_MODEL=
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=
OPENROUTER_APP_NAME=

# Rate Limits (defaults to 0!)
DAILY_GENERATIONS_FREE=5
DAILY_GENERATIONS_STARTER=50
DAILY_GENERATIONS_PRO=-1

# Email (password reset, verification broken)
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@thottopilot.com
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Plus 30+ more...
```

**Action**: Copy all vars from `.env.example` to production `.env`

---

### 2. Test Infrastructure Collapse
**Status**: üö® CRITICAL

```
Current Test Results:
‚úì 23 passing
√ó 60+ failing
‚ö†Ô∏è 500+ tests excluded (not even running!)
```

**What's Excluded**:
- ‚ùå ALL integration tests
- ‚ùå ALL e2e tests  
- ‚ùå ALL caption tests
- ‚ùå ALL worker tests
- ‚ùå ALL payment tests

**Why Tests Fail**:
- Missing `.env.test` file
- Database not seeded in tests
- Type errors (`evidence` can be undefined)
- Missing API mocks

**Time to Fix**: 8-10 hours

---

### 3. Reddit Test Button Broken
**Issue**: "Test Connection" button doesn't work when connected

**Need to**:
- Find the button handler in `reddit-posting.tsx`
- Check what endpoint it calls
- Either implement the endpoint or remove the button

**Time to Fix**: 30 minutes
