## What Changed

### **Component Rename**

- File remains: `/client/src/components/RedditNativeUploadPortal.tsx`
- Legacy export provided for backwards compatibility

### **All Updates Made**

#### **1. Component Definition**
```tsx
// OLD
export function RedditNativeUploadPortal({ ... }) { }

// NEW
/**
 * ImgboxUploadPortal - Uploads images to Imgbox for external storage
 * Used for both quick posts and scheduled posts to ensure legal compliance.
 * Images are stored on Imgbox, then re-uploaded to Reddit CDN when posting.
 */
export function ImgboxUploadPortal({ ... }) { }
```

#### **2. Export Strategy**
```tsx
// Legacy export names for backwards compatibility
export const RedditNativeUploadPortal = ImgboxUploadPortal;
export default ImgboxUploadPortal;
```

#### **3. UI Text Updates**
- **Card Title**: "Native Reddit Upload" â†’ "External Image Upload"
- **Card Description**: "Upload to Imgbox for secure external storage (legal compliance)"
- **Success Toast**: "Image uploaded to Imgbox for external storage"
- **Preview Text**: "Image stored on Imgbox, ready for posting"
- **File Size Error**: "Imgbox uploads are limited to 32MB"

#### **4. Technical Updates**
- **File Size Limit**: 20MB â†’ 32MB (Imgbox limit)
- **Provider Tracking**: 'reddit-native' â†’ 'imgbox'
- **Upload Analytics**: All tracking now reports 'imgbox' as provider

## The Flow Now

```
1. User uploads image in ImgboxUploadPortal
   â†“
2. POST /api/media/upload â†’ Imgbox
   â†“
3. Returns Imgbox URL (https://images.imgbox.com/...)
   â†“
4. Frontend shows preview with Imgbox URL
   â†“
5. Generate caption (uses Imgbox URL)
   â†“
6. Post to Reddit
   â†“
7. RedditNativeUploadService downloads from Imgbox
   â†“
8. Re-uploads to Reddit CDN (i.redd.it)
   â†“
9. Creates post with Reddit CDN URL
```

---

## Backwards Compatibility

All existing imports still work:
```tsx
// These both work:
import { RedditNativeUploadPortal } from './RedditNativeUploadPortal';
import { ImgboxUploadPortal } from './RedditNativeUploadPortal';
```

No changes needed in other components that import it.

## Admin Dashboard Fix

Also fixed the admin dashboard crash:
- Added 'admin' tier to ReferralWidget rewards object
- Prevents "can't access property referrer, h[t.tier] is undefined" error

## Build Status

```bash
âœ… Client bundle validated successfully
âœ… Production build complete
