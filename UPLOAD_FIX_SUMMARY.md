# Reddit Native Upload Fix - Summary

## Issue
Reddit native uploads were failing while captions continued working normally.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Imgbox Subdomain Blocking
The `secureFetchImage()` function in `server/lib/reddit.ts` had an allowlist for image hosting services, but **only included the base domain `imgbox.com`**. When Imgbox returns URLs, they use subdomains like:
- `images.imgbox.com` (original images)
- `thumbs.imgbox.com` (thumbnails)  
- `i.imgbox.com` (alternate CDN)

When the Reddit native upload flow tried to fetch images from these Imgbox URLs (used as fallback), the security check rejected them with:
```
Image URL must be from an allowed hosting service. Got: images.imgbox.com
```

### Secondary Issue: Incorrect Logging
Multiple success/info messages were being logged as `logger.error`, making it difficult to diagnose actual errors:
- Line 774: "Submitting post to r/..." (info message)
- Line 840: "Reddit submission succeeded" (success message)
- Line 949: "Uploading image directly to Reddit" (info message)
- Lines 1611, 1995, 2028: Debug messages logged as errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Imgbox Subdomains to Allowlist
**File**: `server/lib/reddit.ts` (lines 189-192)

```typescript
const allowedHosts = [
  // ... existing hosts ...
  'imgbox.com',
  'images.imgbox.com',  // ✅ ADDED
  'thumbs.imgbox.com',  // ✅ ADDED
  'i.imgbox.com'        // ✅ ADDED
];
```

### 2. Fixed Logging Levels
**File**: `server/lib/reddit.ts`

Changed incorrect `logger.error()` calls to appropriate levels:
- Line 774: `logger.info()` - "Submitting post to r/..."
- Line 840: `logger.info()` - "Reddit submission succeeded"
- Line 949: `logger.info()` - "Uploading image directly to Reddit"
- Line 1172: `logger.warn()` - "Gallery not supported, falling back..."
- Line 1611: `logger.debug()` - "Recorded safety signals"
- Lines 1995, 2028: `logger.debug()` - "Reddit OAuth redirect URI"

## Upload Flow (Fixed)

### Primary Path: Reddit Native Upload
1. User uploads image → caption generation works ✅
2. Image uploaded to Imgur (primary storage)
3. `RedditNativeUploadService.uploadAndPost()` called
4. Image optimized for Reddit (max 20MB, 10000px)
5. **Direct upload to Reddit CDN** via `submitImage()`
   - Returns `i.redd.it` URL
   - ✅ Now works correctly

### Fallback Path: Imgbox Rehosting
When Reddit CDN rejects upload (rare):
1. Image uploaded to Imgbox automatically
2. Returns URL like `https://images.imgbox.com/aa/bb/image.jpg`
3. ✅ **NOW WORKS**: URL passes security check (was being blocked)
4. Reddit link post created with Imgbox URL
5. Success with warning: "Posted using Imgbox fallback"

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Native Reddit Upload
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test upload via Quick Post or Caption Generator
# Should see in logs:
# INFO: Uploading image directly to Reddit (i.redd.it)...
# INFO: Reddit submission succeeded
```

### 2. Test Imgbox Fallback
To test the fallback manually:
1. Use an image that Reddit might reject (very large file)
2. Check logs for: "Posted using Imgbox fallback because Reddit CDN upload failed"
3. Verify post succeeds with Imgbox URL

### 3. Monitor Logs
Before fix:
```
ERROR: Uploading image directly to Reddit (i.redd.it)...
ERROR: Reddit submission succeeded
ERROR: Image URL rejected - not from allowed host
```

After fix:
```
INFO: Uploading image directly to Reddit (i.redd.it)...
INFO: Reddit submission succeeded
```

## Files Modified

1. **`server/lib/reddit.ts`**
   - Added Imgbox subdomains to allowlist (lines 189-192)
   - Fixed 7 incorrect logging levels

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. Start the dev server and test image uploads
2. Verify Reddit native upload works
3. Test caption generation + post flow
4. Check that no URLs are being rejected in logs

### Optional Improvements
1. Add unit tests for Imgbox URL validation
2. Add metrics for upload path (native vs fallback)
3. Monitor error logs for any new host rejections

### Deployment Checklist
- ✅ Code changes complete
- ⏳ Run TypeScript checks: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- ⏳ Run linter: `npm run lint`

## Questions?
If uploads still fail after this fix, check for:
1. Reddit API credentials (REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET)
2. Reddit account connected via OAuth
3. Subreddit permissions (karma, account age requirements)
4. Rate limiting (max 1 post per subreddit per 24h by default)
