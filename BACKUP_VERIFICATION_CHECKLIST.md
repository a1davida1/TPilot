1. Open: https://console.neon.tech/
2. Login with your credentials
3. Select your ThottoPilot project

**Status**: [ ] Done

### **Step 2: Verify Backups Are Enabled** (2 min)

Look for **one of these** tabs/sections:
- "Backups"
- "Settings" → "Backups" 
- "Branches" (Neon uses branches for backup/restore)

**Check for:**
- [x] Point-in-time recovery: **ENABLED** (Neon has this by default)
- [x] Retention period: **7 days** (free tier) or **30 days** (paid tier)
- [x] Last backup: Should show recent timestamp (within last 24h)

**What you should see:**
```
✅ Point-in-time recovery: Enabled
✅ History retention: 7 days
✅ Latest backup: 2025-10-09 20:45:00 UTC
```

**Status**: [ ] Verified backups are enabled

### **Step 3: Note Your Backup Details** (1 min)

Fill in these details from the Neon dashboard:

- **Retention Period**: ________ days
- **Last Backup Timestamp**: ________ 
- **Your Neon Plan**: Free / Pro / Scale
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Enabled / Disabled

**Status**: [ ] Details documented

### **Step 4: (Optional) Test Branch Creation** (1 min)

**Only if you want to be extra safe:**

1. In Neon Console → "Branches" tab
2. Click "New Branch" or "Create Branch"
3. Select "From timestamp" or "From backup point"
4. Choose a timestamp from 1 hour ago
5. Name it: `backup-test-20251009`
6. Create the branch
7. **Verify**: You can see the new branch created
8. **Delete**: Remove the test branch (don't need it anymore)

**Status**: [ ] Optional test completed (or skipped)

---

## ✅ Verification Complete!

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Neon automatically backs up your database continuously
- ✅ You can restore to any point in the last 7 days (free tier)
- ✅ Recovery time: <1 hour using branch restore
- ✅ No additional setup needed - works out of the box

**Next Steps:**
1. Update `docs/runbooks/disaster-recovery.md` with:
   - Retention period from Step 3
   - Today's date as "Last Verified"
   
2. Set calendar reminder:
   - **Next verification**: January 9, 2026 (3 months)
   - **Purpose**: Quarterly backup test

## 🚨 If You Find Issues

**Problem**: Backups disabled or not showing

- **Contact**: Neon support at https://neon.tech/docs/support

**Problem**: Can't access Neon console
- **Solution**: Reset password or contact Neon support
- **Backup plan**: Your DATABASE_URL still works, database is safe
