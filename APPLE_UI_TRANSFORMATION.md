## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. View the Example
Navigate to `/apple-example` to see the new design in action.

### 2. Apply to Existing Pages
Replace old components with new Apple-style ones:

```tsx
// Old
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

// New
import { AppleCard } from '@/components/ui/apple-card';
import { AppleButton } from '@/components/ui/apple-button';
```

### 3. Use the Navigation
```tsx
import { AppleNav } from '@/components/apple-nav';

// In your layout
<AppleNav />
```

### 4. Theme Switching
The existing `ThemeToggle` component now smoothly transitions between modes with Apple-style animations.
